Each one carrying a piece of her boundless love.\n\n2) The Eternal Explorer: At 80+, she had the curiosity of a 21-year-old, traveling from Singapore to Dubai, and finally to Ram Mandir - living life with more enthusiasm than people a quarter her age.\n\n3) The Graceful Goodbye: Seven days ago, she left us exactly how she lived - peacefully, having fulfilled all her wishes, and without suffering. A perfect ending to a life lived perfectly.\n\nHere's to you, Dadi - forever young, forever loved ️",

How we handle failure, not the number of times we fail, defines our growth and resilience. In business and life, taking risks often leads to setbacks, yet each failure is a learning opportunity that fuels progress.\n\nRecently, I read an essay on the common pitfalls of high-potential startups and saw valuable lessons we can apply to our own paths.\n\n𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:\n\n𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁-𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗙𝗶𝘁: If the product doesn’t solve customer needs, it has no place in the market.\n𝟮. 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲: Businesses struggle when they overspend or take on excessive debt. Building slowly, within means, is a powerful path to sustainable growth.\n𝟯. 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀: Ignoring feedback on products or why prospects don’t convert is a critical error.\n𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆: Competing directly with giants often backfires. It’s better to carve out a niche where established players aren’t willing to go.\n𝟱. 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴: Entering the market too early or late can make or break a business.\n𝟲. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 & 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺: Companies fail due to ineffective leadership or team dynamics. Staying grounded in customer needs, over quick wins, is crucial.\n\n𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗧𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗦𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴:\n\n• 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗩𝗶𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Regularly review assumptions, results, and adapt to improve performance.\n• 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲𝘀: Our mission should always serve customer needs, anchoring us to what drives real value.\n• 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Build on strengths, address weaknesses, and avoid ventures outside our core competencies.\n• 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵: Focus on sustainable growth within means, prioritizing resilience over rapid expansion.\n• 𝗟𝗼𝗻𝗴-𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: Embrace a vision for sustainable success, choosing stability over risky short-term gains.\n\nBy embracing calculated risks, adapting quickly to failure, and committing to lessons learned, we can foster enduring success. Here’s to turning setbacks into stepping stones for growth.",

On returning their equipment they took the time to package and wrap with extra care so the computers wouldn’t break but the best part of opening their returned equipment was a hand written note thanking us for the opportunity to work here and having gratitude. I let them know if on their journey they ever needed a reference I would be happy to give one. Years have passed since then and I received a kind text a month or so ago asking for help. I made sure to give them my email, calendar link, and cell for their references. Be kind you never know how your paths can cross again.",

The employee is gone, no slacking.\nCompanies drop the layoff bomb, give no answers, and they are cruel in this message.\nThey kill employee’s chances of getting another job through illegal slander thinking they won’t be caught.\nEmployees laid off with no notice leaves a mess, and companies don’t care who has to clean it up.\n Colleagues ghost departing employees, not the other way around.\nThe employee’s legacy is painted by the company: failure, incompetent, stupid, trash.\n\nLot’s of great talent got laid off in the last two years, and the trauma persists. This post perpetuates their Imposter Syndrome, “I guess I was not good enogh.”\n\nMy recommendation: rewrite this and appeal to an audience who needs to see this.

This team has found a nature-based solution for that...\n\nMicroplastics are these super tiny plastic particles.\n\nThey are smaller than 5mm.\n\nAnd they are basically everywhere now.\n\nFrom the mountain peaks to the ocean trenches.\n\nThey usually break off from bigger plastic.\n\nSo they are called secondary microplastic.\n\nBut here’s the surprising thing.\n\nWe have something called primary microplastic.\n\nWhere we consciously produce microplastic.\n\nAn estimated 2 million tonnes of it every year.\n\nAnd add it to various products.\n\nLike cosmetics, paints, detergents & adhesives.\n\nTo improve their performance.\n\nis tackling this primary microplastic crisis.\n\nWith an innovative solution.\n\nIt has developed biodegradable cellulose microspheres.\n\nThe cellulose comes from certified forestry.\n\nOr agricultural waste.\n\nMade using energy-efficient manufacturing.\n\nAnd with non-toxic, recyclable solvents.\n\nThis can replace the primary microplastic\n\nThat can replace microplastics in everything.\n\nDelivering the same performance.\n\nWhile being environmentally friendly.\n\n***\nStory 505/1000- on a spree to publish 1000 impactful stories in 1000 days.\n\nIf you want to learn more about initiatives such as Naturbeads that are positively impacting the planet, you would love my weekly newsletter ‍️Not My Problem.",
