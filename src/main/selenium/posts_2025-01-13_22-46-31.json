      "content": "PUMA Group's viral 'mistake' turned out to be their most brilliant marketing move of 2025. Here's the fascinating strategy behind it.\n\nI was fascinated by PUMA's recent brand campaign that had everyone talking - but for reasons they didn't expect.\n\nYou might have noticed PUMA's logo mysteriously transforming to 'PVMA' across their social media platforms. The internet did what it does best:\ncreated memes, sparked debates, and drove organic conversations.\n\nWhat looked like a design error was actually PUMA's clever strategy to announceas their brand ambassador.\n\nBold strategies like these have helped PUMA achieve revenues of over 3000 crores in India—more than double that of Nike, which stands at 1200 crores.\n3 marketing lessons from PUMA's viral campaign:\n\n The power of subtle changes - Sometimes the smallest tweak (literally one letter!) can create the biggest impact. The beauty was in its simplicity.\n\n Understanding viral mechanics - PUMA knew that apparent 'mistakes' by big brands get massive attention. They leveraged this behavior brilliantly.\n\n Perfect brand-ambassador integration - Instead of just another celebrity announcement, they wove PV Sindhu's identity into their own brand identity.\n\nIn my 20 years of marketing, I've seen countless brand ambassador announcements.\nMost follow the same template: press release → photoshoot → social post. What made this campaign brilliant was how it turned the formula on its head and let curiosity drive engagement.\n\nWhen you first saw the 'PVMA' logo, did you think it was a mistake or did you catch onto the strategy?",

Beyond what you have already mentioned, I think a lack of transparent communication plays a big role. When employees don’t understand how their work contributes to the bigger picture, they lose motivation.\n\nAnother issue is that companies often focus more on short-term results rather than long-term employee engagement. Recognizing achievements, providing clear growth paths, and offering regular feedback are simple yet effective ways to keep employees engaged.\n\nI also believe companies need to create an environment where employees feel heard. Leaders should encourage open discussions about challenges and provide consistent support not just during appraisals but throughout the year. :)\n\nFinally, fostering a sense of belonging through shared values and strong leadership can make a big difference. When employees feel connected to the organization’s mission and see leadership living those values, they’re less likely to look elsewhere.",

Here’s how I break it down into a system that builds confidence, clarity, and consistent results:\n\n<<<1. Call Structure Check>>>\n--> Did I create rapport?\n--> Did I clearly state the goal of the call?\n--> Did I confidently ask for the sale/next step?\n\n<<<2. Objection Analysis>>>\n--> What objections stumped me today?\n--> Which objections used to feel easy but caught me off guard this time?\n\n<<3. Highlight Reel>>\n--> What’s ONE THING I nailed during this call that I want to replicate next time?\n\nThis simple reflection process turns every sales call—whether a win or a loss—into an opportunity to improve.\n\n What’s YOUR favorite way to debrief after a call?
