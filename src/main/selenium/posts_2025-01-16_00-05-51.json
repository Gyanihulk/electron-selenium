      "content": " AI is booming, and everyone seems to be buzzing about it. Some even say it could replace human effort and make our work so much easier. A thought-provoking question: Is AI truly transformative, or just hype?\n\n Last Saturday, I had the chance to dive into some exciting topics thanks to my long-time friend. We explored trending topics like\n,\n,\n, and\n—breaking down these big buzzwords and discussing how they could impact the construction industry, often seen as pretty traditional.\n\n We also touched on the principles of AI, grouping well-known concepts by function. It’s fascinating to see how different AI systems process prompts in unique ways based on their capabilities, functionality, or application areas. It really shows the diversity of AI!\n\n A big highlight was\ntechnology—it could be a game-changer for Vietnam’s construction industry. With the government pushing for practical tech adoption ( check out Decree 175/2024 in my previous post), Digital Twin could make work and management so much smoother.\n\n️ Of course, there are challenges:\nInitial investments \n- IoT devices ️\n- Training ‍\n- Customization \n- Monitoring \n- Platform syncing \n- Bridging the gap  between what construction teams need and how the IT team implements it—this often means “translating” technical needs into actionable IT solutions, plus handling the legal work involved.\n\n️ Frankly, this role of bridging gaps between construction needs and tech teams could very well be me someday . And I know many of us in this space are already wearing multiple hats!\n\n Big shoutout tofor organizing everything so well and helping us deliver the workshop’s ideas effectively. Your efforts truly made a difference! \n\n And let me be honest: even this post—written with good grammar and structure—got a little help from AI too. It’s incredible how much we can achieve with the right tools and collaboration. \n\n What do you think about the role of AI, Digital Twin, and this “translator” position in construction industry? Let’s share ideas and keep learning together! ",

The purpose of a company is not to make money. The purpose of the car is to go somewhere; fuel will help us get there. Therefore, the purpose of the company is to accomplish something, to advance a greater cause, and to contribute to society—money will help us to get there.”\n– Simon Sinek",

As for getting kids to show a natural smile, a photographer friend of mine said they say something funny before snapping the photo. Like \"Poop!\" Most people can't help but give a real smile in response!\n\n29 years in June for me any my Mrs. Two kids, ages 26 and 22!",

      "content": "When it comes to hiring, it's easy to get caught up in the allure of experience and technical skills. While they’re undoubtedly important, they’re not always the most crucial factors for long-term success. \n\nHiring kind people with a positive attitude often outweighs hiring someone with years of experience but a negative or toxic mindset. Why? Because kindness and a positive outlook create a ripple effect throughout your organization. People who approach challenges with optimism inspire others to do the same, and they foster an environment where collaboration, creativity, and innovation thrive. \n\nA kind team member doesn’t just contribute technically—they build relationships, uplift their colleagues, and create a sense of community within the workplace. On the other hand, someone who brings negativity can drag down morale, making it harder for the team to reach their full potential.\n\nWhile experience is valuable, it’s the character and attitude of a person that will ultimately shape your company’s culture and future success. \n\nWhen you hire for kindness and a positive mindset, you’re investing in a thriving, resilient work environment that encourages growth, learning, and collaboration. \n\nSo, the next time you're looking to expand your team, remember: attitude over experience, kindness over negativity, and positivity over pessimism. It’s the key to building a truly great workplace! ",
