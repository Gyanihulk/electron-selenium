So I jot them down in my notes app.\n\nI call them downloads because it feels like its something flowing through me rather than something Im consciously thinking up myself.\n\nI often read my notes back and think “did I write that?!”\n\nInspiration / ideas come to me from every conversation I have and at least one thing happens to me in my life every day that I could post about or turn into a podcast episode\n\nAnd quite frankly it freaks me out, overwhelms me, and sometimes causes paralysis\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else?!\n\nIf so how do you manage it?!\n\nIm concerned I may have a disorder \n\nP.S Thank God for the notes app \n\nP.P.S It’s gone up to 406 since I took this screen shot yesterday ",

ADHD is often misunderstood and goes undiagnosed, and I suspect I may have it too.\n\nBack when I was a seller, time management was a huge struggle for me. I’d tell my manager:\n\n1. \"I’m busy all day but not accomplishing much.\"\n\n2. \"I get too distracted and can’t focus.\"\n\n3. \"I have too much on my plate and feel overwhelmed.\"\n\n4. \"I know prospecting is important, but I don’t prioritize it.\"\n\n5. \"I can’t figure out what to tackle first.\"\n\n6. \"I waste so much time during the day.\"\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar?\n\nTraditional \"time management\" advice didn’t work for me. What did work was setting intentions. I’d choose 3-5 key goals for the day—like prospecting or emailing—without being overly specific (e.g., \"email prospects\" instead of \"email John\"). I also started segmenting my week:\n\nCertain days are strictly for meetings (internal, customer, or prospect-related).\n\nOther days are dedicated to revenue-generating activities like prospecting.\n\nThis shift helped me stay focused, avoid burnout, and align my priorities with my goals. While sales leadership often focuses on daily activity, I’ve found it more productive to track weekly goals.\n\nWhat strategies have worked for you when it comes to staying productive and focused?",
