Because as we all know, effective managers are often the key to effective teams, and increased revenue capacity.\n\nIn early 2024 we set out to solve the problem we kept hearing about: lack of enablement and insufficient resources for FLMs.\n\nThis was to be our first ever second offering. And the transition from a single product to multi SKU business is not easy. Many before us have failed here.\n\nWe wanted to get it right.\n\nLots of market research, ️\nSurveys of current clients and prospects ️\nEvaluated a number of possible partners ️\nPainstakingly methodical approach to the build ️\nVery defined product marketing and comms plan ️\nEvery detail accounted for ️\nCollaborative team effort ️\n\nFast forward to November, we were finally ready to announce it. Months in the making, our newly built cohort-based Revenue Manager Lab for FLMs was a thing.\n\nThe first cohort is set to kick off on 2/20/25, and today, over a month out, were 90% full and anticipate being completely at capacity early next week and needing to close off registrations.\n\nWe appear to have nailed what the market was looking for in regards to this problem. And we rolled it out and marketed it in the right way.\n\nThe old saying “slow is smooth and smooth is fast” could not be more relevant here\n\nProduct development is hard. Can’t rush it.",

      "content": "I have an impossible goal for 2025, and I want to share the questions I answered to create it. \n\nSometimes, I think I should call myself the Possibilities Coach. I've studied the science of impossible goal setting and believe in my heart that every wild, impossible goal is hidden behind false assumptions of what we believe to be true.\n\nLast week, I gave my Impossible Possibilities workshop to members of The Upside; this question generated the most energy among nearly 70 members.\n\nWhat are the characteristics and qualities of the person who could achieve your impossible goal?\n\nWhen you match the process of believing in your impossibility with IDC (Intentional, Discipline, Consistency) you, your team and your organization can achieve the impossible.\n\nMusk, Bezos, and Oprah are no different than you or me - they imagined an impossible goal, built belief, and took massive action.\n\nThe Four Step Process:\n- Define your impossible goal – something that scares you but excites you even more\n- Question your basic assumptions about who you serve, how you operate, and what defines success\n- Identify the person you need to become to achieve this goal\n- Find the \"WHOs\" – the people who can help make your impossible possible\n- Commit to taking bold action, even when (especially when) failure feels likely\n\nAt, we go deep into the process to reverse engineer goal setting and success with teams and talent. Setting impossible goals is a process of unlocking awareness (around assumptions and the past) and allowing for inspired thinking for a better way forward. If you want to learn more about the process or want to host a team workshop to create the impossible goal, please shoot us a DM.\n\n[Thanks tofor attending the workshop and creating this image of the process!]",
