Statements like \"Microsoft will invest\" refer to future intentions, not present actions. As of now, Microsoft has announced plans to invest $3 billion over the next two years to enhance its cloud and AI infrastructure in India.\n\nWhile this commitment is promising, it's crucial to focus on the tangible benefits that existing cloud AI capabilities offer today. Microsoft's current AI infrastructure is already being utilized to enhance public services, improve healthcare delivery, and support educational initiatives.\n\nBlindly applauding announcements of future investments without understanding their current impact reflects a desire for immediate gratification, akin to expecting instant deliveries. Instead, let's engage thoughtfully with the present capabilities and consider how they can be leveraged for societal benefit. This approach fosters a more informed and proactive community, ready to utilize technology effectively rather than passively awaiting future developments.\n\nIn summary, while future investments are encouraging, it's the present applications of cloud AI that hold immediate potential for societal welfare. Let's focus on that",

This decision highlights a disturbing trend where profits are prioritized over people. Employees are the backbone of any organization, and treating them as expendable undermines their immense contribution to a company’s success. Did the management consider the families who depend on these employees? In a country like India, where social security is minimal, such actions leave people vulnerable, with no safety net to fall back on. The government must step in immediately to address this issue and hold companies accountable for the well-being of their workforce. Organizations must realize that their true strength lies in their employees, not just in profits. It's time to put people first.",

Those who take advantage of every leave in their HR policy (this is 90% of people).\n\n2. Those who think they’ll impress their boss and take as few leaves as possible.\n\nIf you’re in the 2nd category, I’m here to tell you that you’re doing it all wrong.\n\nFirstly, most Indian companies give the bare minimum leave allowance - the least you need for your mental health.\n\nAnd skipping even those leaves doesn’t make you a better employee. It makes you a more exhausted one.\n\nAs a doctor, I’ve seen how chronic stress manifests in patients:\n\n- Insomnia\n- Fatigue\n- Burnout\n\nThe human body isn’t designed for constant output.\n\nAnd mental reset grants you superpowers like:\n\n- 40% more creativity\n- A stronger immune system\n- Higher emotional resilience\n- And a higher life expectancy\n\nSo please, don’t make the same mistake in 2025.\n\nBlock those leaves. Plan a trip. Or just stay home and sleep in.\n\nBecause when you take care of yourself, you’re not ‘slacking off’ — you’re investing in your long-term health, happiness, AND productivity.\n\nSo it’s good for your mind, body and career.\n\nFound this impactful?

Many of those hours in entry-level careers were pure facetime. Hard work needs to be sustainable for us to do it long enough for compounding to kick in.”\n\nShe criticized inefficiencies in workplace culture that reward appearances over output. “Many developed nations work 8–4 but ensure those hours are productive. Come in on time, bring your best, and use technology to be effective,” she wrote, citing her team’s use of AI to reduce grunt work.\n\nvia",
