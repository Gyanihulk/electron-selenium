Studies show 57% of employees leave jobs because of their manager, and 14% have done it multiple times.\n\nEven worse, 32% have thought seriously about quitting for the same reason.\nIt‚Äôs not just about paychecks anymore.\n\nPeople want respect, balance, and opportunities to grow. When managers fail to provide that, it sparks a chain reaction.\n\nAccording to a 2022 report, 4.2 million workers quit, and the ripple effect of one person leaving can cause others to follow.\n\nA study of 1,600 teams found that when a manager lacks agility or key skills, their team struggles too.\n\nMicromanaging? Poor leadership? These push great employees out the door.\nThe fix? Managers who are empathetic, transparent, and supportive.\n\nSkills like trust-building, clear communication, and vision can transform a team.\n\nGood managers don‚Äôt just manage they inspire. And when they do, businesses thrive.",

While it‚Äôs important not to sacrifice health, relationships, or values for money, earning a sufficient salary acts as a safeguard against unexpected challenges, such as job loss. For example, even if a low-paying job feels peaceful, sudden layoffs could leave you financially vulnerable, no matter how supportive your manager may be.\nOn the other hand, individuals with financial stability‚Äîsuch as those from well-off backgrounds or with ancestral property‚Äîmight prioritize peace of mind over a high salary. However, for those without a safety net, earning a higher salary is often not just a desire but a necessity.\nIn my opinion, striking the right balance between financial security and personal well-being is essential for long-term stability and peace of mind.",
