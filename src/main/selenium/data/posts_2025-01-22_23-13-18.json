Here‚Äôs why:\n‚Üí Less chaos = higher morale.\n‚Üí Efficient systems = more profits.\n‚Üí Smooth workflows = fewer bottlenecks.\n‚Üí Seamless processes make Sales look good.\n‚Üí Execution becomes an art form; precision is hot.\n‚Üí It attracts top talent; pros want a company that delivers.\n‚Üí It creates happy clients. Happy clients mean more sales.\n\nBottom line?\n\nAs an ops leader, I've seen this firsthand:\n\nSales is the driver, but ops is the engine.\n\nWithout a well-oiled machine,\nEven the best driver can't win the race.\n\nHave you ever benefited from a rock star ops team? OR:\nOn the other hand, have you ever worked on one?",

      "content": "We talked to 50 sales teams and got an earful about their admin nightmares. Turns out, admin work isn‚Äôt just a headache‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-blown vibe killer. \n\nHere‚Äôs what they had to say:\n\n1. CRMs: Love-Hate Relationship: CRMs are supposed to help, but they often feel like a black hole for time and energy.\nOne rep confessed, ‚ÄúUpdating the CRM is my Sunday night punishment for having a life.‚Äù\nAnother joked, ‚ÄúIf I wanted to write essays, I‚Äôd go back to school.‚Äù\n\n2. Reports: The Weekly Slog Reports are the necessary evil everyone loves to hate. Sales reps spend hours making them look pretty for leadership.\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sign up to be a spreadsheet artist,‚Äù one rep sighed.\nThe average rep loses 6 hours a week to reporting‚Äîthat‚Äôs a lot of coffee breaks lost.\n\n3. Manual Processes: Seriously? From commission calculations to approval requests, manual tasks are productivity killers. ‚ÄúWhy are we doing this manually in 2025? Did automation skip our office?‚Äù the reps quipped.\n\n4. Collaboration Chaos Sales, CS, and Marketing: the Bermuda Triangle of communication.\nReps described it as ‚Äúherding cats with different KPIs.‚Äù\n\nWhat‚Äôs the Fix? It‚Äôs not another overpriced SaaS tool or trust-fall exercises at the next offsite. The solution is better processes and smarter tools that actually save time.\n\nThat‚Äôs where we come in.\n\nAt, we design AI agents that seamlessly integrate with Salesforce to automate the mind-numbing stuff‚Äîlike data updates, report generation, and manual approvals. So your team can stop being admins and start being closers.\n\nTAKEAWAY: Your sales team doesn‚Äôt need more pep talks or pizza parties. They need freedom from admin drudgery. Free them, and watch their productivity (and morale) skyrocket.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the admin task your team complains about the most? Drop it in the comments‚Äîunless you‚Äôre too busy updating your CRM.",

      "content": "Sure, cold email is hard right now. \n\nBut dude, we gotta stop playing the blame game. \n\nIt's not because of poor deliverability rates. It's not because of spam filters. And it's not because people don't use email anymore.\n\nIt's because your email probably sucks. You use copy/paste templates. Sending the same emails to multiple people with different jobs.\n\nAnd not personalizing.\n\nWhat do you expect to happen?\n\nAlright, rant over. Let's talk about what to do about it.\n\nLesson today: Make sure your emails are \"mobile ready.\"\n\nhas some great data on cold emails:\n\n- Prospects are 8x more likely to open emails on their phone\n- Short and mobile-optimized emails see 83% more replies\n- Emails under 50 words get 60% more replies than emails with 150+ words\n\nIf your emails aren‚Äôt short and mobile-optimized, you will not likely get a response.\n\n- Word count: Keep emails under 75 words\n- Mobile ready: Use short, 1-2 sentence paragraphs\n\nThe basic formula looks like this:\n\n Reason: Why you‚Äôre reaching out to the prospect\n Problem: Speaks to the prospect‚Äôs potential problem(s)\n Social proof: References relevant work with similar companies\n Call-To-Action (CTA): Speaks to prospect‚Äôs priorities and problems\n\n===\n\nExample #1: A company that sells electronic document capture software to clinical operations leaders\n\nSubject line variations:\n- FAPI\n- Startup timelines\n- FDA approval\n\nHi Frank,\n\nReason  Saw that you just got FDA approval to proceed with the Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor (FAPI) clinical trial.\n\nProblem  As you launch this trial, we usually hear that manual paper systems and Excel databases create extra work that could delay startup dates.\n\nSocial Proof  We‚Äôre helping operations leaders capture trial data more easily to shorten startup timelines to under 4 weeks.\n\nCTA  Worth a quick chat?\n\nJason\n\n===\n\nExample #2: A company that sells software to help contact centers reduce incoming calls\n\nSubject: Interconnection cost reduction\n\nReason  Saw the announcement of the interconnection cost reduction initiative, Anne.\n\nProblem  Usually, that means there‚Äôs a focus on reducing incoming support calls and pushing customers to self-serve. Support leaders oftentimes run into challenges knowing which digital investments are actually deflecting calls.\n\nSocial Proof  We helped Constellation dramatically reduce cost to serve by finding the sources of increased call volumes.\n\nCTA  Can I share those insights with you?\n\n\n===\n\n\nYou can't get away with mediocre cold emails anymore.\n\nTighten up your message. Optimize for mobile. And invest more time to improve your copywriting skills.\n\nTomorrow, I'm partnering up withto teach the Cold Email playbook we've taught to AE/SDR teams at Shopify, Gong, Rippling, Zoom, and many more.\n\nRegister here to join us:",

I am exposing their wrongful and harmful practices, making it harder for them to get away with it. Encouraging people to stand up to it. To call it out and expose it and the people doing it.\n\nAs a result, I get some pretty ridiculous and insulting comments from these supposed leaders. We can all see right through what their intent is. They never address the point of the post, rather questioning my motivation, my experience, or how often it actually happens, rather than the fact that it happens at all.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I had a full circle moment when I got a private DM from an HR person who on occasion gives me a hard time on my posts. Which BTW when done with respect and logic is welcomed and appreciated.\n\nMy new HR friend was friendly with a female VP at her company who was being mistreated by their employer. She reached out to me to help her get a better severance offer and stand up against the wrongdoing.\n\nIt just goes to show, the people protecting their turf know what really goes on, whether they want to admit it or argue the opposite for the sake of protecting their turf.\n\nThey know how bad it is, they‚Äôve seen it happen or been forced to do it repeatedly.\n\nPretty wild stuff.
