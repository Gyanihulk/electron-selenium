        "content": "You know what’s worse than hearing the truth? Finding out way too late that someone lied to you. Imagine walking into an important meeting, chest puffed, ready to deliver your revolutionary, industry-shaking idea… only for the entire room to go silent. The kind of silence that makes you check if your mic is on. The kind of silence that signals you’re about to be eviscerated.\n\nTurns out, your “brilliant” idea? Your team thought it was horrible, but instead of telling you, they just nodded politely like bobbleheads. Congratulations. You’re now the corporate equivalent of a contestant on a talent show whose family swore they could sing—until Simon Cowell opened his mouth.\n\nThis is why, as a leader, I’d rather tell you the truth & have you hate me than sugarcoat a lie just to be liked. & I expect the same in return. Because a team built on truth is a team that wins.\n\nNow, before anyone accuses me of being heartless, research backs me up. A JPSP study found that people who give direct, constructive feedback are more respected in the long run than those who avoid difficult conversations.\n\nThis means that leaders who sugarcoat, avoid confrontation, or play the “nice guy” card aren't doing anyone a favor. In fact, they’re sabotaging their own teams. If no one trusts you to be honest, you’re just a figurehead, not a leader.\n\nLook, I get it. No one likes to be the bearer of bad news. It’s easier to tell someone, “Great job!” than to say, “Your strategy is as effective as a screen door on a submarine.” But what happens when you choose being liked over being honest?\n\n• Short-term relief, long-term disaster – You avoid an awkward conversation today but set the stage for bigger failures tomorrow.\n\n• Loss of credibility – Once people realize you sugarcoat everything, your words carry as much weight as a fortune cookie.\n\n• Mediocrity festers – Without honest feedback, no one grows. No one improves. & soon, your team becomes a comfortable puddle of meh.\n\nHere’s the catch: If I expect to give the truth, I expect to receive the truth. That means if I have a terrible idea, I need my team to say:\n\n• “Boss, this is terrible.”\n• “You might want to rethink that.”\n• “We love you, but this isn’t it.”\n\n& not just when it's convenient. Not just when I ask for it. I need people who are willing to walk into my office, stare me in the eye, & say:\n\n“Listen, I know you think this is genius, but it’s giving ‘midlife crisis energy,’ & we need to course-correct before it’s too late.” Because if I’m running full speed toward a cliff, I expect my team to yell, “STOP!”—not cheer me on.\n\nAt the end of the day, I can either tell people what they want to hear & watch them fail—or tell them what they need to hear & help them grow.\n\nSo, hate me if you must. Dislike me if it makes you sleep better at night. But know this: When you work with me, you will always know exactly where you stand. Because the truth might sting, but a well-placed lie? That’ll bury you.",

Make your customer the hero, and show how you help them win.\n\n2️⃣ Show, Don’t Just Tell\n\nSaying “We provide the best service” is boring. Instead, tell a story: “Last week, a client came to us frustrated after wasting thousands on the wrong strategy.\n\nIn two weeks, we turned things around, and they finally saw real results.” Now, that’s powerful.\n\n3️⃣ Make It Personal\n\nPeople connect with people, not businesses. Share your struggles, your wins, your real journey. The more human your brand feels, the stronger the connection.\n\n P.S. I’ve built brands through storytelling for years, and trust me, this works. If you’re ready to build a brand people actually remember, DM me.",

        "content": "Nonprofits Need to Increase Their Luck Surface Area:\n\n\nMost nonprofits don’t fail because they don’t care enough.\n\nThey fail because they rely on hope instead of systems.\n\nThey wait for the “right donor” to show up.\n\nThey chase the “perfect grant” that takes months to secure.\n\nThey bank on a “viral moment” to suddenly change their fate.\n\nThat’s not how luck works.\n\nLuck isn’t magic. It’s math.\n\nThe bigger your luck surface area, the more opportunities you attract.\n\nHere’s how nonprofits can stack the odds in their favor:\n\n1. Stop Being a Best-Kept Secret\n\nMost nonprofits talk to the same tight-knit circle:\n\nExisting donors, impact reports, and industry conferences.\n\nYour future supporters aren’t in those rooms.\n\nGet loud. Be where attention already exists:\n\n→ Twitter threads about your boldest insights.\n→ LinkedIn posts that challenge the status quo.\n→ Podcasts where your mission reaches fresh ears.\n\nMore visibility = More serendipity.\n\n2. Build a Magnet, Not a Megaphone:\n\nMost fundraising feels like pushing cold outreach, grant chasing, begging.\n\nInstead, build assets that make support come to you:\n\nA newsletter that shares high-value insights, not just impact reports.\n\nA founder who writes publicly about lessons learned.\n\nA community where supporters feel involved, not just asked.\n\nInbound > Outbound. Every time.\n\n3. Make Non-Traditional Asks:\n\nMost nonprofits ask for donations. But money isn’t the only fuel.\n\nAsk for:\n\nDistribution (Who can amplify your message?)\n\nTech Partnerships (What tools can 10x your efficiency?)\n\nCorporate Integrations (How can companies bake giving into their model?)\n\nFunding follows momentum. Create it first.\n\n4. Adopt a Startup Mindset\n\nSuccessful startups don’t just raise money. They scale.\n\nThey A/B test messaging.\n\nThey automate donor follow-ups.\n\nThey iterate based on real feedback.\n\nNonprofits? Many still send PDFs and cross their fingers.\n\nInnovation isn’t a luxury. It’s survival.\n\n5. Become Undeniable\n\nThe best way to increase your luck?\nBe so good they can’t ignore you.\n\nNail your messaging\n\nShow radical transparency\n\nCreate something that demands to be shared\n\nLuck isn’t about waiting. It’s about working the system.\n\nBuild it. Expand it. Watch what happens.\n\nWith purpose and impact,",

        "content": "We're entering an era where computers are evolving from tools to collaborators, which will shift our mental models of work. Rather than just executing commands, AI will work alongside us—continuing to develop ideas and refine our projects even when we’re away.\n\nImagine spending an hour immersed in a project, then stepping away for dinner or sleep, only to return and find that your AI has been iterating on your work; it’s proactively identifying gaps, exploring new angles, and effectively acting as an extension of your own creativity. Of course, the technology isn’t perfect yet, but as with any major innovation, early challenges pave the way for improvements.\n\nIt’s easy to see the future as AI only, or Human only, but I believe the real winners will be those that blend human operators with AI co-pilots. This is part of the reason I wrote my new book, Superagency, to showcase the ways AI can become a force multiplier that enhances human productivity, unbound by the limits of our own time or focus.",

        "content": "From door-to-door scripts to enterprise frameworks: evolution of a sales professional\n\n\nI recently had an awesome conversation with(Fractional Head of Sales for early stage startups, ex-Shopify, ex-Oracle, ex-IBM). He did something fascinating - demonstrated his exact door-to-door pitch from Vivint from 8 years ago, then broke down IBM's Global Sales School framework live on the show!\n\n\nKey takeaways from our chat:\n\n- Role-playing remains the #1 training method across organizations of all sizes\n- Why understanding buyer personas matter more than product pitches\n- How early-stage startups can learn from enterprise training programs (and vice versa)\n\n\nThe most fascinating part? Hearing Ryan literally reconstruct his sales evolution - from memorized scripts at Vivint to sophisticated frameworks at IBM. His example opening at IBM was gold: combining personal story (door-to-door experience) with business value to create instant credibility.\n\n\nIn the full episode, we covered:\n\n- Vivint's intensive door-to-door training program\n- IBM's legendary Global Sales School experience\n- The stark differences between startup vs enterprise sales training\n- Why understanding customer problems beats knowing product features\n- Key mistakes founders make when hiring their first sales rep\n\n\nOne of the most fun & tactical episodes I've recorded.\n\nCheck out the full conversation in the comments ",
