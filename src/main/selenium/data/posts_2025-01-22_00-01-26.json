It is an ongoing process that requires consistent effort, patience, and clear communication. It takes work, patience, and time. Usually more time than the CEO wants to wait.\n\nBuilding trust required consistent interactions and demonstrating that you will follow through on what you say.\n\nThat means your CMO or Marketing leader will get you to the finish line once that trust is built up and secured. But it takes TIME.\n\nHere are some ways you can building trust with customers:\n1. Focus on building relationships and understanding customer needs instead of going straight for the hard sell.\n2. Provide value by offering educational content that helps customers understand their problems.\n3. Do not skip the relationship-building phase.\n4. Actively listen to what customers are saying and help them put the pieces together for themselves.\n5. Be transparent with prospects about how you work.\n6. Always be authentic to your brand.\n\nIf you're ready to acquire more customers the right way, get in touch for a strategy call. Your reputation is essential for success. Do it right!",

This teaches you to build an LLM-based agent that uses a computer interface, by generating mouse clicks and keystrokes. Computer Use is an important, emerging capability for LLMs that will let AI agents do many more tasks than were possible before, since it lets them interact with interfaces designed for humans to use, rather than only tools that provide explicit API access. I hope you will enjoy learning about it!\n\nThis course is taught by Anthropic's Head of Curriculum,. You'll learn to apply image reasoning and tool use to \"use\" a computer as follows: a model processes an image of the screen, analyzes it to understand what's going on, and navigates the computer via mouse clicks and keystrokes.\n\nThis course goes through the key building blocks, and culminates in a demo of an AI assistant that uses a web browser to search for a research paper, downloads the PDF, and finally summarizes the paper for you.\n\nIn detail, you‚Äôll:\n- Learn about Anthropic's family of models, when to use which one, and make API requests to Claude\n- Use multi-modal prompts that combine text and image content blocks, and also work with streaming responses\n- Improve your prompting by using prompt templates, using XML to structure prompts, and providing examples\n- Implement prompt caching to reduce cost and latency\n- Apply tool-use to build a chatbot that can call different tools to respond to queries\n- See all these building blocks come together in Computer Use demo\n\nPlease sign up here:",

      "content": "A few years ago, I met a software company that saw HR as... paperwork.\n\nTheir view? HR was just there to handle admin tasks, forms, and compliance. Nothing more.\nBut the cracks were showing:\n\n‚Üí Employee turnover was climbing.\n‚Üí Team performance felt stagnant.\n\nThey didn‚Äôt see how HR could play a role beyond the basics.\n\nI asked one question:\n\n‚ÄúWhat if HR could actually help drive business success?‚Äù\n\nThey looked puzzled.\n\nSo, we got to work.\n\nWe focused on transforming the talent experience.\n\n‚Üí Built stronger connections with employees.\n‚Üí Designed strategies to boost retention and performance.\n\nAnd slowly, things changed.\n\nEmployees felt more engaged. Teams started performing better. And the company began to see results where it mattered most:\n\n‚Üí Retention improved, cutting costly turnover.\n‚Üí Performance soared, increasing productivity.\n\nHR wasn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúHR‚Äù anymore. It became a strategic partner in their success.\n\nHere‚Äôs what they learned (and what you might need to hear):\n\nHR is more than just paperwork.\n\n‚Üí It‚Äôs about creating an environment where people thrive.\n‚Üí It‚Äôs about using people to drive business success.\n\nInvesting in your talent pays dividends.\n\n‚Üí Retention saves recruitment dollars.\n‚Üí Performance fuels growth.\n\nYour HR strategy could be the difference between a business that coasts and one that\nthrives.\n\nIt‚Äôs time to treat it like it matters.\n\nIf you agree, please Ô∏è .",
