Panic.\nThe right option? Adapt.\n\nInstead of scrambling, I sat down with my team.\n\nWe refocused our strategy, repurposed the project for another market,\nand within a month, we landed a bigger client.\n\nThat setback? It turned into a growth opportunity.\n\nThis journey has taught me that no plan survives reality.\nMarkets shift, clients change, and the unexpected happens.\n\nThe key? Stay flexible. Learn fast. Move forward.\n\nBut resilience isn’t just about bouncing back.\n\nIt’s about having a team that believes in the vision,\neven when things get tough.\n\nIt’s the challenges that always shape us for the better!",

        "content": "During our life journey, many things occupy our minds and weigh on our hearts. When we struggle with these concerns, we often seek divine help, especially when the challenges feel too formidable to handle alone. Yet, we may wonder if our concerns matter to God. Will he dismiss them as insignificant? Will he help us, or is he only concerned with bigger, more divine matters?\n\nThe answer is that God is certainly concerned about us, and by extension, he is concerned about our concerns. However, his concern may not manifest in the same way as our own. This distinction is essential to understand God’s relationship with us and how he guides us through life.\n\nIn human relationships, a fundamental principle is to value what matters to the other person. If something is important to them, we treat it as important too. For example, a child may consider a toy extremely important. While parents understand the toy is not truly significant, they respect the child’s feelings because the child is important to them. Yet, the parents also know that life involves much more than toys. They want their child to grow and mature, part of which includes gradually elevating their concerns.",

It's sponsorship.\n\n6️⃣ Start a ‘Recognition Roulette’\n↳ Randomly pair employees to give & receive appreciation.\n↳ It builds team bonds!\n\n7️⃣ Pass the trophy\n↳ Create a symbol of success (physical or digital).\n↳ Move that symbol from one star player to the next.\n\nRecognize small wins.\nAcknowledge big goals.\nWatch your culture transform.\n\nBecause recognition isn’t just about words—it’s a strategy to:\n↳ Inspire\n↳ Engage\n↳ Retain top talent\n\nP.S.

Yet, only 1 in 4 companies offer menopause-related benefits.\n\nWomen in midlife are juggling careers, families, ambitions, and major life transitions while navigating a phase of health that’s still largely ignored.\n\n’s latest report spells it out: Most workplaces aren’t built for this phase of life. The lack of midlife health support isn’t just a gap—it’s a talent, engagement, and performance issue. More here:\n\nThe takeaway? If companies want to retain and support talent, they need to:\n\n Expand health benefits to include menopause care, mental health support & preventive screenings—because women deserve real support.\n Normalize conversations—so employees feel supported, not stigmatized.\n Close health equity gaps—because diverse, culturally competent care matters.\n Offer flexibility—because one-size-fits-all policies don’t work.\n Provide whole-person care—because women are more than just their hormones.\n\nMenopause isn’t an expiration date. It’s a powerful transition that companies can support or ignore at their own risk. Investing in midlife health isn’t just good for employees—it’s good for business.\n\n What’s been your experience with menopause in the workplace? Does your company offer menopause-inclusive benefits? If not, why not? Let’s talk.",

Initially we came from a system where CSM's manually added sentiment or renewal forecast based on gut feeling.\n\n2. Then, CSP's positioned rule based health scores as the holy grail. Healthscores def had their merit but has obvious limitations. It’s so easy to lose yourself in setting the perfect healthscore. And very often health scores are:\n\n-> Static - so CSM’s don’t see how they are evolving in time (are they going up or down?)\n\n-> Too vague to be actionable. What does a 7/10 mean?\n\n-> The formulas are over-engineered and CSMs don’t fully understand how the mechanics of the score work.\n\n3. Then came the system that allowed us to move from static health scores to healthscores over time with. Basically showing why health scores are moving up or down.\n\n4. We're now going to a system where we'll be able to show the actual risks that are present at every customer.\n\nThanks to AI—especially the rise of AI note takers—we now have access to an insane amount of customer data that was previously locked in the heads of CSM.\n\nIf we combine conversational data with data that’s present in the CRM we can get way more nuanced in the risks we flag.\n\n-> Detailed risk detection instead of relying on high-level health metrics.\n\n5. Because we know the specific risks per customer can generate actionable risk mitigation, where CSMs clearly see which risks are present and know exactly how to address them.\n\n-> Moving from rigid, checkbox-style playbooks to milestone-based tracking that reflects real progress.",

        "content": "What’s the difference between MVP and POC?\n\nThese terms are used interchangeably, but they actually refer to two different things.\n\nLet me break it down for you real quick:\n\nAn MVP is a product with the minimum set of features required to satisfy early customers.\n\nAlso, to gather feedback for future product development.\n\nOn the other hand, a POC (proof of concept) is a prototype designed to demonstrate the feasibility of an idea before investing in a full-scale development project.\n\nSimply put, an MVP focuses on the user, while a POC focuses on the technology.\n\nAn MVP is about creating a product that solves a problem and provides value to users.\n\nA POC is about proving that a concept or idea is technically feasible.\n\nAnother difference is the level of development required.\n\nAn MVP is a fully-functional product that can be released to the market.\n\nA POC is typically a prototype or experiment that is not yet ready for market release.\n\nIn conclusion, both MVP and POC are important concepts in software development, but they serve different purposes.\n\nSo If you're planning a software development project, it's important to understand the difference between the two.\n\nThat way, you can choose the approach appropriate for your needs.",

        "content": "Two weeks ago, something extraordinary happened.\n\nAt our HR Dinner—a gathering of HR leaders, prospects, customers, and partners—something powerful unfolded that changed the trajectory of a deal.\n\nNo sales pitch. No product demo. Just deep, executive-level conversations.\n\nThe result? A $25K ACV deal closed—faster and with no heavy discounting.\n\nNot because of a better proposal. Not because of a killer deck.\n\nBecause executives talk to executives.\n\nThe Silent Deal Killer: No Executive Involvement.\n\nSellers love to build relationships with their champions.\n\nBut here’s the reality:\n• Champions don’t control budget.\n• Champions can’t make the final call.\n• Champions struggle to sell internally without executive backing.\n\nWithout executive alignment, deals stall, shrink, or die in indecision.\n\nYet most sellers wait too long to involve executives—or never involve them at all.\n\nThe Simple Shift That Changes Everything\nAt Personio, our CRO believes everyone in a commercial organization is selling.\n\nThat means:\n• Our CEO, CFO, CRO, and CHRO actively engage in deal cycles.\n• We orchestrate executive-to-executive conversations early.\n• We don’t wait for champions to sell for us—we guide the conversation at the top.\n\nHere’s how we do it:\n\n𝗧𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝟭: 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲-𝗟𝗲𝗱 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀\nAt our HR Dinner, our CEO, CFO, CRO and CHRO were fully engaged in conversations.\n\nNot about. Not about software. About their shared challenges as executives.\n\nThis type of engagement builds trust faster than any sales pitch ever could.\n\nThe outcome?\n• A faster sales cycle.\n• Zero heavy discounting.\n• A stronger long-term partnership.\n\n𝗧𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝟮: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗘𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸\nEvery week, our CRO personally reaches out to key prospects and customers.\n\nNot as a one-off email—but as a genuine relationship-builder.\n\nHe follows up. He jumps on calls. He invites prospects to our office.\n\nA simple email leads to executive conversations—conversations that close deals.\n\nThe Takeaway: Bring executives in early, not at the end.\nIf your economic buyer isn’t engaged, your deal is at risk.\n\nThe solution?\n• Engineer executive-to-executive moments.\n• Get leadership involved before pricing discussions.\n• Fail fast or close faster.\n\nAt the HR Dinner, the trust built in that room led to a signed deal within days.\n\nHow are you leveraging your executives in deals?\n\n\nPS. Later today, I will break down a GTM playbook on how to work with Executive engagement leveraging your Executives.",

It was the sales leadership, that was aiming at CXO attention as part of a strategic account plan. But not aiming at meaningful and for the customer exec relevant conversations.\n\nWhen I founded ViewComm, I spent a whole lot of time with the famous „Selling to VITO“ book and initially invested days and weeks in writing one proper email to one of these officers. And it worled out pretty well. And meanwhile doesn’t take that long, anymore. \n\nSo, in a nutshell: it’s not about you or your business - it’s always about being relevant, valuable, .. you name it.",

The best teams aren’t made of the smartest people.\n- High social sensitivity matters more\n- Equal speaking time boosts collaboration\n- More diverse groups outperform lone geniuses\n\nThe best teams don’t compete. They compound.\n\nDisagree 1 - Competition is always bad\n- Healthy tension drives innovation\n- Disputes spark better ideas\n- Candor thrives when trust is built\n\nCollaboration wins. But without challenge, ideas stay average.\n\nAgree 2 - Work is social, not solo\n- Great ideas come between people\n- Social capital fuels momentum\n- Trust compounds over time\n\nCompanies don’t have ideas. People do.\n\nDisagree 2 - Leadership is about the best rising\n- The best leaders don’t outshine. They amplify.\n- They create conditions for others to thrive\n- They replace rivalry with trust\n- They build cultures, not kingdoms\n\nSuperchickens rule by suppression. Real leaders win by elevation.\n\nAgree 3 - Helpfulness beats individual intelligence\nThis is brilliant and I’m gonna steal it\n- You don’t need all the answers\n- You need people who give answers\n- Collaboration always outperforms isolation\n\nGreat teams aren’t built on IQ. They’re built on trust.\n\nDisagree 3 - The best succeed alone\nNo...\n- The best producers build networks\n- The best ideas come from collective thinking\n- The best teams prioritize social connection\n\nSuccess isn’t about being the smartest in the room.\nIt’s about making the room smarter.\n\nOverall, the lesson is clear.\nWant long-term success?\nDitch the superchicken mindset.\n\nBuild cultures of trust, challenge, and connection.\n\nWhat’s one way your team could improve collaboration today?\n\n Reshare this post to spread the word!\n Followfor more!",

However I can already notice a difference in having a dedicated work space separate for work + family. When I step into the office, I’m in full work mode. When I step back into the house, I can be fully present as a mom. It’s given me more productivity, more balance, and—honestly—more joy in both roles.\n\nSurprisingly, this past year has been my first stint at ever “working from home” and man I have felt the challenges associated with that. To all you other parents working from home, how do you create separation between work and family life? What are your tips for successfully weaving the two worlds together?",

        "content": "17 psychological triggers to achieve your goals. \n\nDon’t use them to manipulate. \n\nBut to help people make good decisions.\n\nThese 17 triggers are the mental and emotional cues that influence human decision-making and behavior.\n\nThey are often used in marketing, sales, persuasion, and personal influence to drive action.\n\nBut with great power comes great responsibility: For each there is an ethical and an unethical use.\n\nTake scarcity.\n\nEthical use: “Only 10 seats left for the workshop” (if true).\n\nUnethical use: Fake countdown timers or false stock limits.\n\nBe aware so you can protect yourself against those who want to manipulate you.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the 17 psychological triggers:\n\n1. Scarcity\nPeople tend to want things more when they perceive them as limited or rare. (e.g., \"Only 2 left in stock!\")\n\n2. Urgency\nCreating a time limit encourages quick decision-making.\n(e.g., \"Offer expires in 24 hours!\")\n\n3. Authority\nPeople trust and follow experts or authoritative figures.\n(e.g., \"Doctor recommended\" or \"As seen on TV\")\n\n4. Reciprocity\nWhen someone does something for us, we feel obligated to return the favor.\n(e.g., Free samples leading to purchases)\n\n5. Commitment & Consistency\nPeople like to stay consistent with past behavior and commitments.\n(e.g., Signing up for a free trial increases likelihood of purchasing)\n\n6. Social Proof\nPeople look to others for validation, especially in uncertain situations.\n(e.g., \"Over 10,000 customers love this product!\")\n\n7. Liking\nWe are more likely to say yes to people we like.\n(e.g., Influencer marketing, attractive spokespersons)\n\n8. Trust\nBuilding trust increases compliance and conversions.\n(e.g., Testimonials, money-back guarantees)\n\n9. Anticipation\nCreating excitement about something upcoming makes people more engaged.\n(e.g., \"Coming Soon: A Revolutionary Product!\")\n\n10. Storytelling\nStories create emotional connections and make information memorable.\n(e.g., \"How this mom lost 30 lbs in 3 months!\")\n\n11. Curiosity\nPeople are naturally drawn to things that spark curiosity.\n(e.g., \"You won’t believe what happened next…\")\n\n12. Loss Aversion\nPeople fear losing something more than they desire gaining something.\n(e.g., \"Don’t miss out on this exclusive deal!\")\n\n13. Instant Gratification\nPeople prefer immediate rewards over delayed benefits.\n(e.g., \"Get results in just 7 days!\")\n\n14. Specificity\nProviding specific details increases credibility.\n(e.g., \"98.7% of users reported better sleep!\")\n\n15. Contrast\nShowing a comparison makes the choice clearer.\n(e.g., \"Before & After\" images, premium vs. basic plans)\n\n16. Fear\nFear motivates action, especially if a solution is presented.\n(e.g., \"If you don’t act now, you risk losing money!\")\n\n17. Mystery\nLeaving out just enough information makes people want to learn more.\n(e.g., \"This one trick can boost your productivity!\")\n\n Follow mefor more strategies on leadership communication.",

I figured I'd be able to solve any problem or take this idea & actually turn it into a business. It's not like I didn't \"see\" the red flags -- it's just that I disregarded them and told myself we could get through anything.\n\nThe truth is: we were able to fix a lot of these problems.\nAnd many of them, actually became strengths of the business.\n\nBut no matter how many problems we fixed, we could not get over a few major hurdles. Those hurdles only grew over time and eventually led to the downfall of the entire business. Part of me wants to point the finger to all the red flags I now so clearly see (and understand). But I'm realizing that as CEO, your ego can be just as dangerous as inherited or external red flags.\n\nNow, years later, I can reflect with a positive point of view on what was one of the most challenging experiences of my professional career. I'm not mad about what happened. I'm not upset, sad, or even frustrated about this epic fail.\n\nNah. If anything, I'm grateful for the experience, all I learned, and the path it led me down.",

Inspired by its founder, Alina, and the resilience of its employees, Jeet helped set up a Mitti Café at Mumbai airport and pledged to employ 5% differently-abled individuals across the Adani Group. In a heartfelt gesture, the couple personally visited and invited Mitti Café’s team to celebrate their wedding.\n\nIndian weddings are a tribute to art and culture, where every detail reflects exquisite craftsmanship. The Adanis took this a step further by making artisans and NGOs an integral part of their wedding. They collaborated with Family of Disabled (FOD), Delhi, and Kai Rassi, Chennai, to create hand-painted shawls, artistic placards, and digitally printed plates, ensuring that Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) were at the heart of the celebration.\n\nArtisans from across India enriched this wedding with their skills and heritage:\n Munna Ji & Nazmeen (Firozabad) – A father-daughter duo who created exquisite glass décor pieces.\n Bibaji Churi Wala (Jodhpur) – Provided handcrafted bangles, including traditional lac designs.\n Jagdish Ji (Yeola, Nashik) – Supplied Paithani sarees, woven by 400 artisans, for gifting.\n\nThis wedding was a celebration of inclusion, empowerment, and tradition, proving that a wedding can be both a personal milestone and a force for good. By blending love with purpose, the Adani family created a celebration that touched hearts far beyond their own.",

My comment on someone else’s post got 314 likes.\n\nThe author’s post only got 219 likes. My comment on his post got almost 50% more engagement than his post did.\n\nIn addition, my comment generated 28 additional comments, which were pretty fun to read. I guess people feel strongly about PIPs. I know I do.\n\nPeople have a lot to say about PIPs and “leaders” who place all the accountability and responsibility on the employee and very little if any on themselves or the manager.\n\nWhen they start their post off with “As a CEO, here’s the truth”, you know that are about to lie to you. He goes on to talk about things as usual from only the company’s perspective, detached from the realities of the employee.\n\nBelow is my comment I left on the post.\n\n“If a manager needs to put someone on a PIP to motivate them it does not say much for the manager. If the employee is beyond motivation, the PIP is not going to do it, let them go.\n\nHow long does a sales rep have before being put on a PIP? What is their ramp time? When given a PIP, are they given 30 or even 90 days with a 6–12-month sales cycle?\n\nWhat accountability does the manager have in placing the employee on a PIP? Is their performance a symptom or the cause of the problem. How is the PIP justified versus other favored team members not on PIPs with less performance?\n\nIf an employee has been given the proper support, training, enablement and opportunity over a reasonable amount of time, it should be clear to both sides that it is time to go. It should never come as a surprise.\n\nGive the time you would place them on a PIP to find a job while they still have a job, and if they haven't by then, let them go and give them a decent severance package. Much more humane than chasing unachievable goals with the threat of termination hanging over your head”.\n\nI’m pretty tired of these “leaders” who use their position of authority to misrepresent things to unknowing employees. It’s bad enough they do it to employees in their own company, we don’t need to see it here.",

Hopefully people can come to appreciate (and afford) the benefits of a boutique experience. \n\n\"To be fair,is quickly turning into a joke. We live in an age of abundance; one of the strongest needs that people have is to be able to navigate decisions with confidence quickly. The most powerful way to do this is via brands; the other is through curation or filtering. Try buying almost anything from Amazon these days, and you get 60 identical products with the same photography, different random brands, at different prices with different delivery speeds, arranged in order of how much they bribed Amazon. It’s a mess.\"",

Key ethical concerns were highlighted, including biased outputs, inaccuracies, privacy issues, and the need for transparency and accountability.\n\n️I emphasized that teaching AI ethics should be a mandatory component of our curriculum, ensuring students are equipped to navigate and shape the future responsibly. Moreover, we discussed the necessity for clear guidelines on the use of generative AI by instructors and the importance of institutional policies that promote ethical AI usage to uphold academic integrity.\n\n️In this era of AI, it's evident that traditional assessment approaches need reevaluation. We must develop new methods that reflect the evolving landscape and ensure our students are assessed fairly and comprehensively.\n\nThanx to the educators for taking the time to be here today and for your dedication fo shaping the minds of the future.\n\nGrateful tofor hosting this event, and forandfor organizing the event.\n\nAs we move forward, let's commit to fostering an environment where innovation thrives alongside ethical responsibility, preparing our students not just to participate in the future, but to lead it with integrity.",

But hey, who could blame me? It’s not easy to prepare for the big leagues. \n\nEventually, though, I figured it out. I needed structure — and once I had that, things started to click.\n\nHere are the THREE HABITS that helped me land my dream role at Microsoft:\n\n Solving at least three new problems every day — that tiny commitment built momentum like I never imagined.\n\n Taking the time to analyze and document every solution. I even created a public GitHub to track my journey (some of those solutions were *a bit* embarrassing at first).\n\n Focusing on quality, not speed. I wasn’t rushing through problems; I was making sure I thoroughly understood them.\n\nNow that I’ve made it to Microsoft, I can look back and see how these small, consistent efforts made all the difference. \n\nAnd if you’re looking to follow a similar path and need assistance, check out Bosscoder Academy.

        "content": "Paradigms may be killing your business…\n\nA cause of miscommunication and business stagnation is Paradigms.\nParadigms are accepted norms, patterns of behavior or a shared set of assumptions.\n\nThey are models that establish boundaries or rules for success.\nParadigms are structural barriers to creativity based on psychological, cultural, and environmental factors.  For example:\n\n Where people sit – once they find a seat that is their seat for the rest of the event.\n Statements such as, “It’s always been done that way.” or “That’ll never change.”\n Stereotypes for men and women and their roles in business, family, and society.\n\nParadigms are Not All Bad…\n\nParadigms are not all bad, such as which side of the road to drive on.  When they become barriers to progress they become damaging, because what is “impossible” with one paradigm is “doable” with another.  People either understand their paradigms or risk being left behind.\n\nBusinesses change paradigms simply because, “We didn’t know any better.”\nThey did something different.  When paradigms change, everyone starts over.\n\nIdentifying Paradigms\n\nYou see and hear paradigms on a continual basis.  Phrases like, “We’ve always done it that way” or “That’ll never happen” (the two most dangerous phrases ever uttered in a company) are signals of the existence of paradigms.  This prevents progress because it locks people into narrow solutions and avoiding risks and growth.\n\nThe story below illustrates how risky that can be.\n\nWhich country dominated the watch industry until 1970?  The Swiss.  In the 1950’s, they had 50% of the market.\n\nWho invented the quartz watch?  Max Hetzel, a Swiss engineer in 1954.\n\nIn the late 1960’s a quartz watch by Seiko and a Swiss watch consortium was presented at Swiss watch conventions.  However, the Swiss watch makers didn’t embrace the quartz watch because their craftmanship was part of the Swiss National Identity.  They were locked into a paradigm.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1983 Swiss watch makers went from 1,600 down to 600.  Swiss watch employees went from 90,000 down to 28,000.\n\nWhat Paradigms have you seen in your business?\n\nWhat did you do about them?\n\nLet’s Do This",

Paradigms can be silent killers of innovation, yet they’re often invisible to those stuck in them.

Breakdown matters ↓\n- People skim in an F-shape pattern.\n- Keep sections bite-sized and structured.\n\n2. Typography keeps it clean ↓\n- One font for headings, one for subheadings.\n- Limit to two fonts for consistency.\n\n3. Color makes it pop ↓\n- Use 2-3 primary colors max.\n- Play with opacity if you need variety.\n\n4. Icons enhance clarity ↓\n- Only use icons when necessary.\n- Make sure they come from the same set.\n\n5. White space improves impact.\n- Give your content room to breathe.\n- More space = better readability & appeal.\n\n6. Use any design tool ↓\n- Figma, Canva, Keynote - it honestly doesn't matter:\n- I you can do shapes, text, and lines: it works.\n\nPro tips ↓\n\n Pick a mini-topic (relevant and specific).\n Fill up empty spaces with relevant visuals.\n Make people think, “I can apply this today.”\n\nA great infographic isn’t just design - it’s tactical.\n\nMake it easy to read, engaging, and valuable.\n\nFollow+for more content creation tips.",

It’s a masterclass in focus and clarity, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed by a never-ending to-do list.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nStep 1: Write down the 25 goals you want to achieve by the end of 2025.\nStep 2: Circle your TOP 5 most important goals.\nStep 3: Here’s the kicker—everything you didn’t circle becomes your “avoid-at-all-costs” list. You don’t touch those 20 until your top 5 are fully achieved.\n\nWhy?\n\nBuffett’s philosophy is simple: “Good” goals are the enemy of exceptional results.\n\nSuccess comes not from doing more but from doing less, really well. Top performers obsess over their priorities and say no to distractions—even ones that seem worthwhile.\n\nThe takeaway?\n Focus exclusively on your top 5 priorities until they’re fully implemented.\n Say no to everything else—even “good” opportunities—until the work is done.\n\nLess noise. More impact.\n\n What’s one thing you’d add to your “avoid-at-all-costs” list?\n\nLet’s stop chasing everything and start excelling at a few things.",

I may be young, but I am somebody.\nI may be small, but I am somebody.\nMy clothes are different. My face is different. My hair is different.\nBut I am somebody.\nI must be respected. Protected.

Since the subconscious mind influences our behavior and decision-making, we can program it daily for success through I AM statements.\n\nDaily repetition of your major goals and I AM affirmations takes mere minutes and has the magnitude of rocket fuel for your becoming.\n\nThank you, NFL, for reminding us that I AM somebody.",
