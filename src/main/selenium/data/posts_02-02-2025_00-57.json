Coupled with the internet, this gave rise to an era of digitization and automation.\n• 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐭𝐡 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 describes what is happening right now - the era we are living in. The physical world, the digital world, and the virtual world are colliding together, creating smart products, smart factories, and entirely new business models. This revolution has been primarily driven by 𝐜𝐲𝐛𝐞𝐫-𝐩𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 (𝐈𝐨𝐓), 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 to create a highly intelligent, integrated, and automated manufacturing ecosystem that spans far beyond the traditional “factory floor.”\n\nIndustry 4.0 is not merely a matter of connecting machines and products through the Internet. 𝐈𝐭’𝐬 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐦 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐭 in how we organize, manage, and approach business. As a society, we are starting to feel the impacts of Industry 4.0 already. Not only are companies investing at record levels, but also governments around the world have been pouring money into this idea as the way of the future.\n\nThe concepts inspired by Industry 4.0 boil down to 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐚𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, and telling business leaders what to do and when to do it. The companies winning today aren’t just the ones who collect the most data, but the ones who can make that data think for them.\n\nSo the real question is: Are you still automating, or have you started thinking?\n\n𝐃𝐞𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐞:\n\n*******************************************\n• Visitfor access to all my content and to stay current on Industry 4.0 and other cool tech trends\n• Ring the  for notifications!",

How you treat others matters.\n\n\n2. Stay humble. Growth comes from learning.\n\n\n3. Communicate with empathy. Understand before reacting.\n\n\n4. Lead with integrity.

Our senses are directly tied to how we feel. Visuals of warm, comforting foods trigger nostalgia and positive emotions.\n\n→ It bridges the gap for online-only products. You can’t physically touch, smell, or try products online, but Rhode uses creative direction to show you exactly how their products might feel, smell, or even taste.\n\n→ It makes products memorable. The association of a lip tint with honeyed toast or a balm with cinnamon buns sticks in your mind long after you’ve scrolled past.\n\nThese aren’t just pretty visuals; they’re storytelling tools that help customers connect with the product on a sensory level.\n\nIn a world where many products are available exclusively online, sensory marketing can bridge the gap between digital screens and real-world experiences.\n\nWhat do you think about this trend of pairing skincare or fashion with food?",

This product is:\n\nAffordable - $75/mo gets you 50 minutes and the message hub that not only allows you to see/manage your calls but also makes it easy to teach and train the AI receptionist.\n\n100% self-serve - users can sign up and start forwarding calls in 10 minutes or less.\n\nGuarantees all calls are answered in 2 rings - this allows businesses to confidently invest in marketing knowing they won't have to pay for leads they miss.\n\nIt takes an extremely dedicated and maniacally focused team to make this happen and I can't wait to share more later this week about how each of these guys brought our dream into a reality.you are our dream team and we couldn't have done any of this without you all!\n\nIf you'd like to learn more, or even better start building your AI Voice receptionist, visit",
