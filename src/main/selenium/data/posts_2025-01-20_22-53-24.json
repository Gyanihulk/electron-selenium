Not from investors, not from an agency‚Äìfrom a partner who'd joined just last year. \n\nThose 8 digits hitting their account marked the final chapter of my 10-year, $5.2M journey to 92% ownership of Groove and Helply.\n\nIt started with the classic partnership playbook.\n\nFirst the vision: \"We'll scale this together, take it to new heights.\"\n\nThen reality: Our paths just weren't aligned.\n\nNo hard feelings‚Äìjust a $2.7M reminder that sometimes the best partner is yourself.\n\nIt was a heavy wire to send.\n\nBut, it made me reflect on what really matters: shared control and true ownership.\n\nBecause here's something partners don't seem to understand:\n\nI've spent 10 years buying back $5.2M in equity because I believe in running this my way.\n\nI'm not building for exits. I'm building for my family.\n\nWe're wildly profitable (50%+ EBITDA), growing steadily (without the unicorn chase), and delivering exactly what I want ($5M ARR, complete control, zero pressure). That's the whole point.\n\nIf you're running a profitable bootstrapped SaaS business in 2025, you can choose your path.\n\nIn today's world, if you can grow sustainably‚Äìyou don't need anyone's permission to build it your way.\n\nWhen your timeline is generational, you can either chase other people's dreams or buy back every single percentage point until it's truly yours. I choose ownership. I choose family.\n\nI choose the long game.\n\nIn this market, partnership offers mean nothing if you're building for your children's children.\n\nHere's to another 10, 20, 30 years of grinding‚Äìmy way, at 92% ownership and counting.",
