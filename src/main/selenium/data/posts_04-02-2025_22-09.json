𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗢𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀\n\nIn healthcare, preparing for industry changes-such as advances in telemedicine, AI, or patient engagement tools-requires looking beyond incremental improvements. By staying open to emerging technologies, practices can adapt and leverage new opportunities to improve patient outcomes.\n\n𝟮. 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲\n\nFocusing solely on optimizing existing processes may limit resources for exploring new care methods or adopting advanced tools. Innovation in healthcare is essential to opening up new possibilities for patient engagement, improving outcomes, and delivering personalized care.\n\n𝟯. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲\n\nIn a fast-evolving industry, healthcare practices that only refine internal processes risk falling behind competitors who innovate and implement cutting-edge technology. Patients increasingly look for providers who stay current with medical advancements and patient communication methods.\n\n𝟰. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗡𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀\n\nReliance on past successes can lead to overlooking shifts in patient expectations, such as a desire for more accessible communication or integrated health records. While refining processes enhances efficiency, adapting to new patient demands strengthens retention and satisfaction.\n\n𝟱. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\n\nOverinvesting in current processes without reallocating resources to new initiatives can limit potential growth. A balanced approach enables practices to invest wisely in both process refinement and innovative tools that elevate patient care.\n\n𝟲. 𝗟𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻\n\nWhile operational efficiency is necessary, maintaining a strategic vision that includes innovation is key to long-term growth. Practices that balance process improvement with forward-looking initiatives cultivate resilience in an evolving healthcare environment.\n\nIn healthcare, a balance of efficient processes and bold innovations is essential for sustainable growth, improved patient care, and patient loyalty.",

Ditch the 3-5 year experience trap for entry-level roles:\n↳ Experience doesn't predict performance. Potential does.\n\n2. Sports and side hustles show more potential than degrees:\n↳ Real-world hustle beats theory every time.\n\n3. Start interviews with: \"What did you teach yourself last month?\"\n↳ The best predictor of future growth is past curiosity.\n\n4. Hire for learning speed and curiosity:\n↳ Fast, eager learners outperform experience.\n\n5. Ditch the \"hit the ground running.\" Give them a 90-day roadmap:\n↳ The fastest way to grow is a clear plan.\n\n6. Let juniors mentor seniors – they know what's next:\n↳ The future belongs to digital natives. Let them lead it.\n\n7. Celebrate failures that led to learning – they're future wins:\n↳ Every mistake is a lesson your competition hasn't learned yet.\n\n8. Normalize saying \"I don't know yet\":\n↳ The smartest people are comfortable not knowing.\n\n9. Start meetings with: \"Here's what I learned this week.\"\n↳ Learning cultures outperform knowing cultures.\n\n10. If someone has the right attitude, invest in their training:\n↳ Attitude is everything. The rest can be taught.\n\n11. Let talent take big risks – mentors are the safety nets:\n↳ Safe paths never led to extraordinary results.\n\n12. In reviews and 1:1s, ask, \"How did you grow?\"\n↳ Growth mindset > Fixed skill set.\n\n13. Juniors spot opportunities others miss – give them a voice:\n↳ Fresh perspectives solve problems experience can't see.\n\n14. Your top performers aren't always the best teachers:\n↳ Double your talent by rewarding both doing and teaching.\n\n15. Make \"teaching others\" a promotion criterion:\n↳ Leaders who teach create more leaders.\n\nStop asking for experience.\nStart creating it.\n\nYour next star is waiting. Give them a chance.\n\n️ Repost to help others.\n Followfor more.",

        "content": "That wooshing sound of a deadline flying by. I'm sure we're all familiar with it. But how far along the \"todo\" list were you by then?\n\nIt seems like projects will always exceed their deadlines and budgets. Software projects are notorious for \"meeting\" their deadlines when the delivery isn't even halfway. If you think about it, it's not that strange. In many software projects, we're doing something for the first time with a group of people we don't know for a customer who doesn't know what they really want.\n\nLast week, during a discussion with colleagues, we stumbled upon the challenge of predicting how long something takes. Developers love estimating their work because it's always clear what needs to be built and under what conditions, and we've done exactly that dozens of times before. Not...\n\nAgile methodologies tried playing into this uncertainty by breaking up long projects into smaller cycles. Even then, Scrum's typical 2-week cycle is too long. We still can't clearly estimate how much work we can do in those two weeks. Why? Nobody can clearly state 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 needs to be built.\n\nI love this about Event Modeling. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. It focuses very nicely on all the details of what needs to be built. Instead of vague descriptions, open for much interpretation, it provides a structured, detailed outline of the steps a system needs to take to finish a certain task.\n\nDoes that make Event Modeling the holy grail of estimating work? Unfortunately not. A message that denotes communication with an external system will still involve much more work than a message that represents an internal action.\n\nEvent Models can be split into slices. One slice is the state-change slice, which takes a user action, converts it into a command, and produces one or more events. Another is the state-view slice, which takes events, updates information and provides that to—for example—a user interface. Lastly, there is the automation slice. It takes information and produces a command that may result in one or more events.\n\nSlices are small and have very few side effects. Any side effects are mostly visualized as additional slices elsewhere. This makes Event Modeling's \"slice\" a great \"unit of work.\" The boundaries are clear, and the dependencies of other slices are well-defined.\n\nDoes that mean we can sell an event-modeled project for a fixed price? Well, perhaps not. Personally, I think the slices allow us to build much more sensible units of progress that we can measure during a project. We'll be able to compare our progress of slices to the speed at which the deadline nears. And as you get better at it, you can start predicting how long things will take.\n\nMaybe, one day, we'll hear the woosh of a deadline while we're already celebrating the project's successful delivery...\n\nHow, if at all, do you measure progress?",

Yet still historical information of how much time per slice it takes would vary between teams and team members.\n\nIn my case I used it on a project already ongoing, so I could get the input for the statistical model from past stories.",

Compete on Value.\n↳ Being always responsive = replaceable.\n↳ High-impact work = trust.\n↳ Try this: Deliver results, not instant replies.\n\n2/ Balance Isn’t a One-Time Fix. It’s a Daily Choice.\n↳ You don’t “achieve” balance - you choose it daily.\n↳ Ask yourself: Is this how I want to spend my time?\n\n3/ Master the Art of Visibility Without Overwork.\n↳ Hard work alone isn’t enough - visibility matters.\n↳ Try this: “Here’s what’s done, what’s next,\nand where I need input.”\n\n4/ Protect Your Energy Like a CEO.\n↳ If leaders prioritize thinking time, so should you.\n↳ Block deep work hours like an unmissable meeting.\n\n5/ Own Your Priorities, Not Just Your To-Do List.\n↳ If you don’t set your priorities, someone else will.\n↳ Ask: If I could do one thing today, what should it be?\n\n6/ Learn to Say No - Without Actually Saying No.\n↳ No doesn’t make you difficult - it makes you strategic.\n↳ Try this: “I can do this, but X will have to wait.\nDoes that work?”\n\n7/ Automate, Delegate, or Eliminate What Drains You.\n↳ More hours ≠ more impact. Smart work > Hard work.\n↳ Ask: Can a tool do this? Can someone else?\nDoes this need to happen?\n\n8/ Don’t Just Manage Time - Manage Attention.\n↳ Time management fails if focus is scattered.\n↳ Minimize distractions. Batch tasks. Protect deep work.\n\n9/ Set a Standard for How People Work With You.\n↳ You train people by what you tolerate.\n↳ Try this: “I check emails between X and Y.” Stick to it.\n\n10/ Work as If You’re Training Someone to Replace You.\n↳ Leaders delegate, document, and build systems.\n↳ Try this: Train others, systematize,\nfree yourself for bigger things.\n\n11/ If You Want Balance, Stop Trying to \"Have It All.\"\n↳ \"Having it all\" is a myth - prioritize what matters now.\n↳ Ask: What’s most important in this season of life?\n\n12/ Detach From Urgency Culture.\n↳ Not everything is a fire drill.\n↳ Ask: What’s the real deadline?\nPush back on false urgency.\n\n13/ Use Constraints to Work More Efficiently.\n↳ Work expands to fit time - set limits.\n↳ Try this: Cut deadlines in half, focus harder.\n\n14/ Think in Systems, Not Just Tasks.\n↳ Don’t repeat - optimize.\n↳ Ask: How can I automate or delegate this?\n\n15/ Audit Your Calendar Regularly.\n↳ What’s scheduled gets done - but should it be?\n↳ Remove unnecessary meetings. Batch tasks.\nReclaim time.\n\nIf you could eliminate one unnecessary work habit from your life, what would it be?\n\n️ Share and support your network.\n Follow Meera Remani for impactful leadership insights.",

It's about the small, consistent efforts to make people feel valued and heard.\n\nSo, take a moment today to think about the people in your life - your team, your family, your friends.\n\nWho can you show appreciation for today?\n\nFollow for more",

That’s why I believe in initiatives like Builder Blueprints—a streamlined, founder-friendly approach to legal docs that helps startups get it right from the start.\n\nHaving everyone on the same page with privacy and compliance doesn’t just reduce risk—it improves outcomes for users, businesses, and the industry as a whole.

        "content": "Deepseek R1 is shaking up the AI race.\n\nHow?\n\nIt delivers near-O1 performance—at 1/27th the cost.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n↳ Architecture: The Sparse MoE Advantage\n\nDeepseek R1 uses a Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with a double reinforcement learning approach.\n• Unlike O1, R1 relies less on supervised training, meaning it learns autonomously from its mistakes.\n• Grok-1 from xAI follows a similar approach, favoring reasoning over a dense-first design.\n• OpenAI’s O1, however, combines reinforcement learning with supervised training from models like GPT-4o.\n\n↳ Why R1? It’s 27x Cheaper than O1\n\nThe real game-changer: cost efficiency.\n\nInput token cost per million:\n• Deepseek R1 → $0.14 (cached), $0.55 (non-cached)\n•OpenAI O1 → $7.50 (cached), $15.00 (non-cached)\nOutput token cost per million:\n• Deepseek R1 → $2.19\n• OpenAI O1 → $60.00\n\n↳ Distillation: Open-Source Flexibility\n\nR1 can be distilled into smaller models—and they’re already available on Ollama.\n• You can run 1.5B to 7B versions of R1 locally.\n• OpenAI O1? No distillation yet—only O1 Mini.\n\n↳ Reasoning & Prompting Optimization\n\nR1’s research suggests zero-shot prompting outperforms few-shot for reasoning models.\n• Being more direct in prompts enhances the model’s logical capabilities.\n\n↳ How Does R1 Compare to O1?\n\nCodeforces Percentile:\n• Deepseek R1 → 96.3\n• OpenAI O1 → 96.6\nMath & SWE Reasoning Tasks:\n• Deepseek R1 → 79.8 (AIME 2024), 97.3 (MATH 500)\n• OpenAI O1 → 79.2 (AIME 2024), 96.4 (MATH 500)\n\nR1 holds its own against O1—and even outperforms it in math and software engineering tasks.\n\nWhat This Means for the Future of AI\n• R1 proved that reasoning models don’t have to be expensive.\n• With R1’s open-source push, OpenAI may be forced to make O1 more accessible.\n• R1 is open-source: more developers and labs can build on top of it to build cheap and powerful models.\n\nDeepseek R1 changed everything.\n\nNow, what does this mean for you? I wrote a full deep dive here: charafeddine[dot]co\n\nP.S. If you would like to learn AI, you will love my weekly newsletter (it’s free).\n\nMake sure to subscribe to receive your letter.",
