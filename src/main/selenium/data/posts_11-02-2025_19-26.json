It's a symmetry-breaking event. Your gradient tweaks won't save you.\n\nThe math is unforgiving: recursive reasoning requires exploring the full configuration space before wavefunction collapse. This isn't an engineering problem - it's fundamental quantum mechanics.\n\nWe're hitting the Shannon bound on naive inference. But recursive architectures are quantum tunneling through the complexity barrier, establishing new ground states in cognitive phase space. This is the real economic consequences, a bifurcation point.\n\nThe concerning part: The gap between organizations with access to this compute regime and those without grows as exp(t). Market dynamics undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking. Power concentrates along new attractors.\n\nWe witnessed this playout, when Deepseek's R1 -model, triggered a $2 Trillion drop in the market.\n\nBut the noise contains signal. Understanding these mathematical constraints lets us shape the attractor landscape rather than being shaped by it.\n\nStop optimizing surface metrics - start studying the quantum mechanics of recursive cognition.",

        "content": "hashtag\n#justathought\n\nLately, I have been deeply reflecting on the state of architectural practice, particularly in smaller cities. There was a time when architects aspired to be part of visionary projects—projects that challenged them, pushed boundaries, and left a lasting impact. But today, I see a shift. More and more architects prefer to work independently, taking on small-scale projects just to stay free from long-term commitments. While independence is empowering, I fear that the spirit of collaboration, the drive to build something monumental, is gradually fading.\n\nEvery time I hire talented individuals, they learn for six months or a year, then leave to start their own practice, taking on projects for as little as ₹5,000 or ₹10,000. And they are content with it. But where does that leave the future of large-scale, high-value architecture? Where are the teams that dream of building cities, redefining skylines, and taking on projects that require vision, dedication, and long-term association?\n\nIf this trend continues, what happens when the current generation of architects leading multinational firms retires? Who will step up to take on those grand responsibilities? Architecture is not just about individual survival—it’s about collective progress. It’s about creating something that outlives us. But that requires commitment, patience, and the willingness to work as a team.\n\nBeing in a small town, I constantly strive to bring people together, to form a team that can take on ambitious projects. But finding architects who share this vision is becoming increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges, I remain committed to finding a way forward. I believe there is a solution, and I am determined to crack it.\n\nTo all architects out there—where do you see our profession in the coming years? Are we truly building the future, or are we just settling for convenience? It’s time we rethink our approach and bring back the spirit of collaboration, growth, and ambition in architecture.",

To just be competitive now with any type of PPC ads you need a budget starting at $1500/month.\n\n$5-10 a day won't win any of the bids and the ads won't get seen. You have to have a super savvy placement strategy as well. Ot is no longer a simple process (if you want real results). You have to consider:\n\n- time ad runs\n- limit you set for spend for each hour segments you choose\n- retrieving formulas - no retrieving and you also likely won't get seen much.\n\nI am a big fan of ads but the days of just dabbling with low funds sadly are gone. Anything less is literally wasting time and money.",

I can't remember with who at this point, I suck I know.\n\nMy answer.....\n\n- Talk about the work. What needs to be done, the how and so on\n- Talk about the work, what needs to be done and the how BUT is the one to do it. Not just talk but action.\n\nWhen I got laid off and started to officially do fractional work publicly I realized I am limited to my hours. I personally don't want to build a team either but I do need the help. Instead of 2 clients I could take on 5+ if I had access to people who could take the IC work off my hands.\n\nThat is where I went toand said \"you should build this community of fractional executives all the way to IC side hustling individuals\". I was that side hustle fractional guy. I didn't have a home. I didn't have a place I could offer up my services or ask for someone else to come in to do something I didnt want to do. Tyler loved the idea andsaid let's do it.\n\nI reached out to 100 people. 50 in network and 50 out of network, only took an hour, and within 24 hours I had new connects and 40-50 convos.\n\nThe only issue..... These were all fractional executives like me. I needed to find those who were doing fractional work as a side hustle for a couple hours a week.\n\nTHAT is the hard part. How? Well through you all. Through those doing the fractional work full time. They have to know them....\n\nIf you know them, send them my way. We just launched the slack community. We have listings of fractional executives already live on PartnerStacks website. Let's help drive Fractional even further as an early option to companies instead of hiring.\n\nIt would probably save a ton of head and jobs honestly. Fractional will vet out the seriousness of the executive team and the buy in of the other teams. We get in, create progress and hit road block after road block.... bullet dodged for that person trying to work there.\n\nOn the other hand, we get progress, buy in and so on a job opens up and we leverage our network to fill it!\n\nSome names in this community already,,,,,,,,and several others!",

I mean sticking with outdated strategies while the world moves on.)\n\nHere’s what used to work:\n Posting on 3-5 platforms multiple times a day.\n Cold emails & calls.\n Complex funnels.\n Expensive ads.\n\nThat was my strategy for 15+ years. Then it stopped working.\n\nI had to rebuild from scratch—and after nearly $1M in mistakes, I created a simple system that works today.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n1️⃣ Research with AI → I use AI to deeply understand my ideal clients and their “Value Journey.”\n2️⃣ Help them → I provide high-value content—free—that helps them move forward.\n3️⃣ Ask → I check if they liked what I shared. If they want more, I give them more.\n\nNow, instead of chasing clients, they come to me. I spend more time doing what I love—and they get the results they want.\n\nI put a guide together that walks through this process step by step. Want a copy? Let me know, and I’ll send it your way.\n\n(See how this works? I’m giving you real value. You just have to ask. If you like it, you can ask for more. Easy.)",

If a small task needs to be done, either a follow-up or sending a reply, or scheduling a call, the quicker you do the better.\n\nIf the whole team functions the same way, it just gets easier for everyone.\n\n You can take a weekend off, but your mind has multiple tabs open.\n\nI am working on the \"overthinking\" part. But, well! I overthink client calls, what are we doing for them, and new leads that I would love to work with!\n\nAnd that's okay!\n\n Finally, it's okay to stop comparing with others. Just compare it with your past self.\n\nWhat would be your top learning this year?",

At 52?\nShould you be stepping off the field or preparing for a fresh innings?”\n\nI shared the story of Sunil Gavaskar, who famously took fresh guard after reaching each century—a reminder to stay focused, recalibrate, and keep playing.\n\nThis struck a chord.\nA few weeks later, he came back with a spark in his eyes.\n\nHe hadn’t just shifted his plans—he had reimagined his future.\n\nWhile he didn’t say it out loud, his actions were clear: he was ready to play to his potential.\n\nThis idea of staying in the game, of leaning into possibility rather than stepping back, is central to’s Play to Potential – Lead a Full Life, Become the Best You.\n\nDeepak, a stellar professional with roots in IIT Madras, IIM Ahmedabad, and London Business School, and a career spanning McKinsey, KPMG, and Egon Zehnder, chose to pivot in 2016.\n\nHe embraced executive coaching and launched the Play to Potential podcast—an exploration of life’s tipping points and purposeful transitions.\n\nHis book builds on these insights, offering readers a structured, relatable, and deeply human guide to rediscovering their potential.\n\nWhat Makes This Book Stand Out?\n\n1️⃣ Reframing Midlife:\n\nThe first section, The Long and Messy Midlife, speaks to those of us in our 40s and 50s wondering, “Is this all there is?” It challenges us to look beyond the “treadmill” of success and rediscover what truly matters.\n\n2️⃣ Self-Reflection Made Practical:\n\nIn Getting in Touch With Ourselves, Deepak emphasizes 360-degree feedback and aligning with our values. He shares how he found his “sweet spot”—helping others unlock their potential.\n\n3️⃣ A Roadmap to a Fuller Life:\n\nThe book’s highlight is the FLAVOUR framework:\nF: Family context\nL: What you love\nA: Aspirations and choices\nVO: Value and opportunities\nU: Investing in yourself\nR: Relationships\n\nThese aren’t abstract ideas—they’re actionable, brought to life through stories of individuals who’ve pivoted mid-career to pursue joy and fulfillment.\n\nWhy You Should Read It?\n\nDeepak doesn’t just ask us to “work” to our potential; he invites us to play. And when we play, we tap into creativity, passion, and joy.\n\nThe book isn’t a monologue—it’s interactive. QR codes link you to expert voices, and stories from diverse professionals inspire you to rethink your own possibilities.\n\nIf you’ve ever found yourself wondering what’s next, Play to Potential is a toolkit for reinvention.\n\nFollowfor more.",

        "content": "3 Years of Running SocialPlug Media – 10 Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier…\n.\n.\n.\nThree years ago, I took a leap of faith and started SocialPlug Media.\n\nNo roadmap. No guarantees. Just a vision and relentless execution.\n\nFast forward to today we’ve helped 50+ brands grow, generated results and built something real. But the journey? Far from smooth.\n\nI’ve made mistakes, faced setbacks and learned these powerful lessons every entrepreneur should know.\n\nIf you're running (or planning to start) a business, read this.\n\n1. Clients Don’t Pay for Hard Work - They Pay for Results\n\nI used to think \"the harder I work, the more I'll earn.\" Wrong.\n\n- Focus on impact, not effort. - Charge for value, not time.\n\n2. Sales > Skills (If You Want to Survive)\n\n- Learn how to pitch. - Master client psychology. - Don’t fear rejection - it’s part of the game.\n\n3. Not Every Client is a Good Client\n\nSaying NO to the wrong clients creates space for the right ones.\n\n4. Building a Personal Brand = Inbound Leads on Auto-Pilot\n\nIn the first 2 years, I chased clients. Now, clients come to me.\nWhy? Personal branding.\n\n- Post valuable content. - Share your wins & failures. - Be seen as an expert, not just another agency owner.\n\n5. Systems & Processes > Hustle & Chaos\n\nHustling 24/7 is not a strategy.\n\nBuild repeatable processes so things run smoothly, even when you're not around.\n\n6. Your First Hire Will Change Everything\n\nTrying to do everything alone is the fastest way to burnout.\n- Delegate early. - Hire for execution, so you can focus on growth.\n\n7. Raising Prices Will Scare You, But It’s Necessary\n\nI used to undervalue my services. Then, I doubled my prices and clients STILL said yes.\n\nHigher prices = Higher quality clients.\n\n8. 80% of Problems Come From 20% of Clients\n\nSome clients will bring more stress than revenue. Know when to fire a client - your peace is worth more.\n\n9. The Market Rewards Those Who Stay in the Game\n\n- Show up daily. - Adapt to trends. - Keep playing the game.\n\n10. Money is Just a Tool - Your Health & Relationships Matter More\n\nI’ve seen agency owners make big money but lose themselves.\nWhat’s the point of success if you’re burnt out, unhealthy, or alone?\n\nBalance is key. Work hard, but don’t forget to live.\n\nIf I could go back, I’d tell myself one thing - be patient, stay consistent and keep learning.\n\nNow, I want to hear from you:\nWhat’s one lesson you’ve learned in business?",

Play it too safe: “I'm not sure, but I want to learn and grow.\"\n\nHere’s the thing—recruiters aren’t looking for a *perfect* answer.\n\nThey’re assessing:\n\n Your clarity of goals – Do you have a vision for yourself?\n\n Your alignment with the company – Will they invest in you and lose you in a year?\n\n Your adaptability – Can you grow with changing business needs?\n\nSo, how do you craft a solid response?\n\n Tie it to the role:\n\n“In the next five years, I see myself mastering financial analysis, taking on complex projects, and contributing to strategic decision-making within the company.\"\n\n Show progression, not entitlement:\n\n“I want to deepen my expertise in FP&A, work on cross-functional initiatives, and eventually mentor junior analysts as I grow.\"\n\n Balance ambition with flexibility:\n\n“While I have a strong interest in leadership, I believe growth is a continuous process.\n\nMy focus will be on developing skills that add value to both the company and my career.\"\n\nA well-thought-out answer not only makes you stand out but also reassures the interviewer that you're invested in the role.\n\nHow do you usually answer this question?

Building trust in digital payments requires deep expertise and constant innovation—and’s five-year journey in our Trust & Safety team is a testament to this.\n\nLet’s hear what she has to say on her career trajectory and PhonePe’s culture of investing in talent and developing future leaders - \"I began my career with PhonePe in March 2020 as a Risk Investigator in the Trust and Safety Team. My expertise primarily focused on consumer risk investigations. Over the past five years, I progressed through roles and I’m currently working as a Manager, where I lead a team of talented individuals. Working in this team exposed me to the complexities of the payments ecosystem and gave me an opportunity to work on various initiatives aimed at enhancing customer experience, driving automation, and building robust fraud detection systems. Each role added a new dimension to my understanding of risk, fraud, and customer safety. I have been fortunate to contribute to some impactful projects at PhonePe such as building data-driven models to detect anomalies and fraudulent behavior, ensuring proactive measures to protect users, designing customer Fraud Awareness Campaigns, gaining exposure to  Merchant Risk Investigations and AML Compliance and ensuring we stay ahead of potential threats. Additionally, I contributed to automating risk investigation workflows, improving efficiency and reducing manual effort in repetitive tasks. These projects helped build a secure, scalable fraud prevention framework, improving not only the security posture of the platform but also enhancing customer experience.\n\nLeading my team has been a highlight. I am passionate about creating a culture of collaboration, growth, and knowledge sharing. We have achieved some great things together, including significantly reducing response times for fraud investigations and developing future leaders within the team. This journey at PhonePe has been invaluable.  I am excited to see what the future holds and continue contributing to a safer and more secure platform for our users.\"\n\nKudos to Asha for her inspiring journey!",

We think if we worry enough, plan enough, stress enough, we can guarantee victory.\nBut dragons aren't meant to be controlled. They're meant to be faced.\n\nThe real breakthrough comes when we realize that our job isn't to control the dragon, it's to show up and face it. Imperfectly. Bravely. One step at a time. Just like my client did.\n\nSometimes the most powerful thing we can do is break free from the spell of perfect control and trust in our ability to handle whatever flames come our way.\n\n What dragon feels less fierce when you stop trying to control every aspect of it?

Software development is maximum penetrated.\n\n2. Augmentation > Automation – 57% of usage helps humans refine work, while 43% automates tasks.\n\n3. Who’s using AI? – Peaks in mid-to-high wage jobs (software dev, data science), low in manual labor & highly regulated fields (e.g., restaurant workers, physicians).\n\n4. Most common tasks? - Writing, critical thinking, programming.\n\nAnthropic in general have popularity among developers - therefore it is common to see high usage in programming tasks and computing profession.

Long overdue.\n\nI just don’t have the time or energy to be fighting with the trolls in the comments, regardless how amusing it can be at times.\n\nThey also don’t deserve the attention.\n\nThe troll trolls, they get blocked right away. They are just offensive and have their own agenda, they are not even smart enough to attempt to cover it up.\n\nThe leaders, HR, lawyers who want to come at me. I give them a chance. If they are not overly disrespectful, I will engage to reemphasize the point of the post.\n\nI love and encourage respectful, well thought out, intelligent opposing views. Much better than the automated button pressing “agrees” or “insightful” lazy comments that many leave. I have had many incredible discussions in the comments just like this. Nothing better.\n\nUnfortunately, respectful disagreement happens less than the disrespectful troll comments who only want to poke and prod and make you look bad. Where they get personal and question your credibility. I used to love to go back at them twice as hard. No more.\n\nWhen they double down with more garbage it’s time to be done. If they show up on another post or start jumping on other’s comments with the same garbage, they are blocked and poof they’ve disappeared from the LinkedIn universe at least from my view.\n\nThe blocked button is amazing, powerful, and a huge time savings.\n\nBye bye trolls. You don’t deserve to see my content.",

You don't notice the slow decline until you suddenly find yourself trapped.\n\nThe good news is that a career rut is not a life sentence, you have the power to pivot, grow, and step into new opportunities.\n\nHere are some steps that I took that helped me which I know would help you too.\n\nIdentify the ROOT CAUSE: Ask yourself what exactly is making you feel stuck? Is it a toxic environment, misalignment with your goal or lack of growth?\n\nReassess your personal long term goals and vision: If it does not align with that of the company you work with, then you need to consider a change of career. If it does then that leads us to the next step.\n\nTalk to your current employer about enriching your current role.\n\nConsider learning a new skill or upskill: This would bring a new excitement and spark.\n\nExpand your network: Engage with professionals in your industry by attending networking events.\n\nSeek Professional Help If Needed: If stress, anxiety, or burnout is taking a toll, speak to a career coach, therapist, or mentor.\n\nDon’t ignore signs of mental exhaustion—your well-being is just as important as your career.",

It was a glimpse behind the curtain.\n\nThe question isn't whether we're better off having seen it.\n\nThe real question: If the pioneers of AI creativity aren't showcasing their own technology on advertising's biggest stage—what does that tell us about the gap between the promise and the present reality?\n\nI want to know what you think.

Now, before you assume this is one of those entrepreneurial flexes to make you believe I've always been some uber-successful titan of business, it is very much not.\n\n\nIn fact, we were nearly broke and living in a vacuum with no purpose or fulfillment.\n\nThe trip was entirely funded by the owners of our company and included their wives. It seemed like an overtly generous gesture at the time, but in reality, it was one of many luxury carrots dangled in front of my unchecked lust for the world's perception of success.\n\nThese temptations were always accompanied by \"If you work hard enough and sacrifice enough, you can live a life like this too, Kevin.\"\n\nI did work hard and sacrificed more than I would like to admit. And I got big results, but little valid rewards. The even harsher reality was that it was all in pursuit of a perverted illusion of worth. I was living a life that did not represent my personal or professional values, and I was miserable.\n\nI'll spare the details of how I was able to exit that high-speed train to destruction shortly thereafter, but it was definitely a significant turning point in my marriage, fatherhood, leadership, and career pursuits.\n\nI thank God for peeling the scales from my eyes to reveal the fallacy of success before it got much, much worse.",

Because R1's reasoning isn't emergent—it's an inevitable consequence of constraint satisfaction in high-dimensional parameter space. V3 isn't just initialization; it's the ground state that shapes R1's entire energy landscape.\n\n>The GRPO equations reveal the meta-game: DeepSeek isn't building a new model, they're engineering constraints that force specific cognitive attractors. This isn't evolution, it's directed annealing under carefully chosen thermodynamic constraints.\n\n: When you control the optimization constraints, you control the cognitive phase space. R1 isn't discovering reasoning—it's flowing along V3's pre-carved optimization channels. That's not a limitation, it's the point.\n\nThis isn't about better training—it's about who architects the constraints that shape artificial cognition. GRPO shows us the blueprint.\n\n️ Follow me for more",

        "content": "7 Uncomfortable Truths About Holding Grudges (That May Surprise You)\n\n\n\nWe've all been there – that lingering resentment that feels somehow justified. But what if I told you that holding onto grudges might hurt you more than the person who wronged you?\n\nResearch fromForgiveness Project reveals that people who hold grudges experience higher blood pressure, increased heart rate, and elevated cortisol levels when merely thinking about their grievances. Consider this:\n\n1.) Your brain can't distinguish between past and present pain.\n↳ When you replay that grudge, your body releases the same stress hormones as during the initial incident. According to neuroscience research published in, this repeated stress response can shrink your hippocampus – the brain region crucial for learning and memory.\n\n2.) That \"justice\" you feel? It's an illusion.\n↳ Studies atdemonstrate that revenge fantasies activate the same brain regions as drug addiction. You're not serving justice; you're feeding a costly psychological habit.\n\n3.) Professional success suffers silently.\n↳ Research from theshows that employees who hold grudges experience a 30% reduction in workplace collaboration efficiency and are 65% more likely to miss opportunities for advancement.\n\n4.) Holding grudges restructures your personality.\n↳ A groundbreaking longitudinal study from thefound that long-term grudge-holders became less open to new experiences and scored lower on emotional intelligence assessments over time.\n\n5.) Your innovation capacity takes a hit.\n↳ When grudges occupy mental real estate, your brain's executive function – responsible for creative problem-solving – becomes measurably impaired. This effect persists even when you're not actively thinking about the grievance.\n\n6.) The \"they deserve it\" fallacy.\n↳ Studies in cognitive psychology reveal that grudge-holders consistently overestimate both the impact of their resentment on others and the satisfaction they'll receive from maintaining it.\n\n7.) Grudges feel like physical pain.\n↳ People who hold grudges report the same levels of life dissatisfaction as those experiencing chronic pain. The psychological burden weighs as much as physical suffering.\n\nThe path forward?\n\nReleasing a grudge isn't about forgetting or condoning. It's about choosing your neural real estate. As Maya Angelou wisely noted, \"You can't forgive without loving. And I don't mean sentimentality. I mean understanding that someone is limited by their background and history.\"\n\nYour mental real estate needs new management.\n\nCoaching works; let's chat.\n\n\n Book Your Coaching Discovery Session Today:",

We didn’t just show up - we showed what we stand for.\n\nEvery conversation, interaction, and moment was a chance to share, listen, debate, and most importantly, deliver. And through it all, one thing remained constant, our promise.\n\n\"Count on us to deliver\" isn’t just something we say, it’s the way we move. It’s in the way we think, the way we build, and the way we connect. Whether it was deep tech discussions or casual exchanges over coffee, ideas sparked, perspectives shifted, and the energy of possibility filled every space we stepped into. We didn’t just engage in conversations, we made them matter.\n\nWe thrive on challenges, we seek out opportunities, and we step up when it matters. As we leave, we don’t just take back insights; we take back momentum, the kind that drives us to push further, think bigger, and keep delivering. Because for us, the journey isn’t about a single event, it’s about everything that comes next.",

        "content": "B2B eCommerce Success: Beyond Software, Into the Real World\n\nOver the years, I’ve come to realize that true B2B eCommerce success isn’t just about software implementation—it’s about deeply understanding how businesses operate in the real world. Technology is just one piece of the puzzle; the real magic happens when you connect it with the day-to-day realities of manufacturing, logistics, and wholesale distribution.\n\nI learned this early in my career while working with one of the world’s largest polyester manufacturers in Indonesia. I spent time on the factory floor, watching how computers communicated with machinery. Being part of an Oracle implementation taught me a crucial lesson—if a truck gate pass wasn’t printed, shipments couldn’t leave the factory, no matter how perfectly the system was set up. That experience shaped the way I think about B2B operations.\n\nLater, when I moved to the U.S., I took over day-to-day operations at a commercial printing company. Again, working on the ground reinforced my belief that technology should serve the business, not the other way around.\nJust recently, I visited a B2B customer near Boston and spent time understanding their manufacturing process. Seeing firsthand how our Magento-powered eCommerce platform supports their operations was a great reminder of why I love this space.\n\nTo my fellow B2B eCommerce professionals, consultants, and solution providers—I encourage you to step beyond the software and spend time on a factory floor. Watch how products are made, how orders are fulfilled, and how real-world constraints affect the business. The best solutions come not just from technical expertise but from true business empathy.\n\nHow many of you have spent time on a factory floor or in a warehouse? What lessons did you take away from that experience? Let’s share and learn from each other.",

But here we are \n\nWhen I started marketing, I had the same questions too. And after working with startups, big brands and helping them meet their marketing targets, I’ve noticed a pattern, everyone asks the same questions. So, let’s clear them up once and for all:\n\n1️⃣ Do I need a degree to be a great marketer?\n\nNo. What you need is SKILL. Experience beats theory every time. Take courses, learn, experiment and actually market something (even if it’s your own LinkedIn presence).\n\n2️⃣ Which platform is best for marketing?\n\nIt depends on your audience. B2B? LinkedIn. Gen Z? TikTok. E-commerce? Instagram. But the best platform is the one where you can consistently provide value.\n\n3️⃣ How do I get my first marketing client/job?\n\nShow your work. If you can’t find opportunities, create them. Write case studies, document your learnings or even revamp a brand’s strategy for free to build credibility.\n\n4️⃣ What’s the secret to going viral?\n\nConsistency + Relatability + Timing. Going Viral is a mix of value-driven content, emotions and luck. But sustained growth? That’s from showing up daily.\n\n5️⃣ How do I stand out in this crowded industry?\n\nBy being YOU. Your unique experiences, insights and voice are your competitive edge.
