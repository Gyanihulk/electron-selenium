Whether you're charging at home or on the go, the design offers an alternative EV charging solution that can be safer and more convenient than ever.\n\nThe GHOST flat cable is weather-resistant, preventing freezing and stiffening in cold temperatures which makes it unique in their current ability to perform under the toughest conditions.\n\nWith the capability to deliver up to 40A and 9.6kW, Ghost provides up to 30 miles of charge per hour.\n\nIn Europe and China, their 50A model delivers up to 48 miles per hour, ensuring fast and efficient charging for all EVs. Plus they offer a mode three cable.\n\nPlus, the charger’s low profile meets ADA requirements, making it safe for pedestrians and still offering high performance.\n\nThey are also working on a retractable wall charger, and later on an inductive charging pad featuring their flat cable technology.\n\nClearly they are well positioned to provide a flexible, reliable solution for city dwellers, suburban homeowners, and businesses.\n\nNice work/ David Sirieix",

Automation.\n\nRoutine tasks like rebalancing portfolios or generating reports—things that once took hours and used to be done manually—can now be done in minutes. This frees up time for me to do what I love the most: building relationships and strategizing for long-term growth.\n\nAI is an ‘enabler’ to all of us - AI is not just analysing past trends anymore, it's about reacting to your behavior in real-time - quickly & effectively!\n\nAnd that's where it enables we private bankers to create ‘impact’ in a better way!\n\nThe future of private banking isn’t about choosing between AI and humans—it’s about blending the precision of technology with the empathy of human connection.\n\nPrivate Banking has evolved beyond just market analysis and suggesting a specific product depending upon the client's need! It has become more of ‘𝘤𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘧𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘤 𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘧𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘰𝘴’ with a blend of changing market dynamism and the values that need to be adhered!\n\nAt the end of the day, private banking is still about trust, relationships, and understanding the human side of wealth creation.\n\n𝐀𝐈 𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐩𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 ‘𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬’, 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐩𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 ‘𝐇𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧’.\n𝘍𝘰𝘳 𝘌𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦 - 𝘞𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘩 𝘈𝘐/𝘋𝘦𝘦𝘱𝘛𝘦𝘤𝘩 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘶𝘱 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘩 𝘴𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳/𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘺 𝘮𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘴 𝘢 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘰𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘪𝘯 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘧𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘰 - 𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘸𝘦 ‘𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘯𝘬𝘦𝘳𝘴’ 𝘣𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 ‘𝘪𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘤𝘦𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦’ 𝘝𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘦!\n\nMoreover, it's NOT just about the ‘human touch’, it's about bringing ‘VISION’ for using new age technologies like AI to create ‘Sustainable Wealth’.\n\nSo, to answer my client’s question: AI won’t replace private bankers.\nBut those who don’t embrace AI? Now, that’s a risk they can’t afford to take.\n\nHow do you see AI shaping your industry? I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

For those of us in finance and strategic planning, the profound value a home brings reminds us that investments aren't solely about numbers on a ledger—they're about nurturing human experiences.\n\nFor first-time buyers, here's a strategic yet heartfelt approach: Prioritize neighborhoods that offer community-building amenities, visualize versatile spaces that adapt with your family's growth, and weigh long-term environmental impact to align your values with your financial commitment.\n\nIn an era of fast-paced digital transactions, let’s not forget that some investments, like a home, offer returns in ways financial markets cannot quantify. Choose wisely to not only grow your asset portfolio but to invest in a lifetime of memories.\n\n\n\nHow does your home investment serve your soul as much as your wallet?
