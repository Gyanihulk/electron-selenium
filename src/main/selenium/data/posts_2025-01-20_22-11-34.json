She shared a powerful perspective on why most enablement initiatives fail: treating enablement like a vending machine instead of a strategic partner.\n\n\nKey insight: You can't just push a button and get instant results. Like any good sales process, enablement needs discovery:\n\n- What's the real problem you're trying to solve?\n- Has this training been done before?\n- How will we measure success?\n- What's the timeline for meaningful impact?\n\n\nIn the full episode, we covered:\n\n- How JLL runs their \"Power Hour\" program across 600+ global sellers\n- Practical frameworks for building sustainable enablement programs\n- Strategies for engaging multi-generational remote teams\n- Why random training requests kill enablement effectiveness\n- Tips for aligning with sales leaders and getting executive buy-in\n\n\nSomething that really stood out: Brooke's team maintains a 70/30 split between programmatic and ad-hoc enablement - proving you can balance structure with flexibility.\n\n\nWant to hear the full conversation on building effective everboarding programs?\n\nCheck out the link in comments ",
