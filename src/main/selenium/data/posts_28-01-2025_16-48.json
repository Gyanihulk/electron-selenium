        "content": " Board Perspective: The AI Value Shift We Can't Ignore\nJust watched a fascinating CNBC segment with remarkable Leslie Picker and the brilliant R \"Ray\" Wangthat perfectly illustrates why boards need to radically rethink AI investment strategies.\n\nDeepSeek's recent breakthrough is a wake-up call for corporate boards: They've achieved top-10 global AI performance using just ~2,000 NVIDIA chips, at roughly 5% of traditional development costs ($5.6M vs. $100M-$1B).\n\nThree key technology governance implications I'm discussing with my fellow directors and CIOs:\n\n1. The democratization of AI is accelerating faster than most boardroom discussions acknowledge. When a $2.19/million token model rivals $60/million competitors, we need to reassess our technology investment thesis.\n\n2. Resource constraints are driving innovation, not limiting it. DeepSeek's pure reinforcement learning approach proves that capital-efficient AI development is possible – and boards must double down with this insight.\n\n3. Open-source AI is becoming a strategic imperative, not just a technical choice. The transparency and adaptability of these models could fundamentally reshape competitive dynamics in our industries.\n\nFor my fellow board directors: We must evolve beyond asking \"Should we invest in AI?\" to \"How do we leverage this democratization of AI capabilities?\"\n\nCritical questions for your next board meeting:\n- Is our current technology governance framework equipped for rapid AI evolution?\n- How are we balancing proprietary vs. open-source AI strategies?\n- Are we prepared to capture both operational efficiencies and revenue opportunities from AI?\n\nThoughts? Would love to hear perspectives from other board members navigating this shift.",

However, my friend insisted that I visit her place and spend some time enjoying fun activities.\n\nIt had been a while since I traveled purely for enjoyment and not for work, so I decided to say yes.\n\nShe planned everything—where we’d go, what we’d eat—and when I reached her home in Delhi after an 8-hour bus journey, I wasn’t feeling well.\n\nMy bus was delayed, and during the journey, I caught cold and developed a headache. I arrived at her place at 10:00 PM and told her how I was feeling. She mentioned that it would be better to stay in at late night.\n\nSeeing my discomfort, my friend introduced me to theapp, which delivers medicines in Delhi within\n.\n\nIt was my first time using the app. I selected the “without prescription” option, and to my surprise, I received a call from their team. They inquired about my symptoms, how long I’d been unwell, and confirmed all the details before processing my order.\n\nAs promised, the medicine arrived in 29 minutes—just like food delivery! After taking the medicine, I started feeling much better.\n\nIf you haven’t tried the Apollo 24|7 app yet, I highly recommend it. Your health should always be your first priority.\n\nApollo offers a complete range of services, including online doctor consultations, an online pharmacy, and at-home lab tests—all backed by 40 years of trust in the Apollo network.\n\nThey’re building India’s largest healthcare platform with the belief that life is precious and quality healthcare should be accessible to everyone.\n\nThank you, Apollo 24|7, for your amazing service!\n\nYour quick medicine delivery and helpful support made a huge difference when I needed it the most.",

Aaarrgghhh.....\n\nWe’ve all been there. Right? Right????\n\nStanding in the produce aisle, wrestling with a flimsy plastic bag that refuses to open.\n\nYou pinch, you roll, maybe even blow on it like a magician trying to summon a spell.\n\nAnd just when you’re about to give up and walk away bagless, voilà—it opens.\n\nFunny thing is, after some reflection, I figured that this annoying bag has a lot to teach us about life and business.\n\nHere are three quick lessons I’ve gleaned from the produce aisle battlefield:\n\n1️⃣ 𝙋𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙋𝙖𝙮𝙨 𝙊𝙛𝙛\n\nThat bag will open eventually, but only if you keep at it.\n\nIn business (and life), results rarely come instantly. Frustration is part of the process — don’t let it make you walk away from your goals.\n\n2️⃣ 𝙍𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙏𝙤𝙤𝙡𝙨, 𝙍𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙪𝙡𝙩𝙨\n\nEver notice how a tiny bit of moisture makes the job easier?\n\nThe same applies to your work. Using the right tools or resources can turn a struggle into a breeze.\n\nHow's ChatGPT or Co-pilot working out for you? \n\n3️⃣ 𝙋𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙖 𝘿𝙖𝙨𝙝 𝙤𝙛 𝙃𝙪𝙢𝙤𝙪𝙧\n\nSometimes, you’ve just got to laugh at the absurdity of the situation.\n\nA sense of humour can transform frustration into resilience, helping you stay composed under pressure.\n\nSo next time a bag tests your patience, remember: every little struggle has its wisdom — if you're willing to unpack it.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n𝘏𝘪, 𝘐'𝘮 𝘈𝘯𝘥𝘺, 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳 𝘰𝘧 𝘊𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘚𝘰𝘭𝘶𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘢𝘵 𝘙𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘐𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘎𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘧𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.𝘴𝘨.

We were recruiting for a Chief of Staff role at an AI startup tackling retail fraud. The response rates were insane.\n\nWhy? Timing and access are everything.\n\nThese candidates would never have found this role organically - they weren't connected to the founder and wouldn’t have seen their job board. So when we brought the opportunity to these candidates, they jumped at the chance.\n\nWe got so many responses we stopped outreach after 3 days. \n\nThat's the gap we're aiming to bridge at- connecting top talent with incredible opportunities they'd otherwise miss.",

Both transitions-moving from an MNC to a startup and vice versa come with their own challenges and benefits. When you move from an MNC to a startup, you bring structure, processes, and a larger-scale perspective, which can be super valuable for a startup. But to succeed, you’ve got to be ready to take on ownership beyond your job description and be okay with ambiguity. On the flip side, going from a startup to an MNC can mean adjusting to a slower pace, hierarchical structures, or a more process-heavy environment.\n\nAt the end of the day, success in either environment isn’t about where you have worked earlier - it’s about how quickly you can adapt and whether the company has the right support system for people making such transitions. Writing off candidates based on their past experience could mean missing out on some game-changing talent.",

I needed to know if Twitter was a place where I could grow a following without having to grow a community. Meaning I spent maybe 4 live hours on the platform during the 90 days resharing, liking, and commenting otherwise I was a ghost.\n\n\nSpoiler alert: I could not grow a following as a  (or at least not in 90 days).\n\n\nRESULTS -\n\n357 followers\n\nMy very best-performing post got 186 impressions\n\nI didn't pay for an account meaning I don't have access to analytics v Premium, but my rough estimate is -\n\n25-30K total impressions\n\n0 leads\n\n\n TL:DR\n\nTwitter was not the no-effort lift I hoped for, but 25K + impressions in exchange for 10 hours of work (which I could probably do in 6-7 hours now that I'm more familiar with the platform), isn't a bad trade-off.\n\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of recent comments and actions made by Elon and other tech oligarchs, I don’t feel comfortable continuing to post content on X.\n\nI had a really difficult time making this decision.\n\nI worry that removing my voice (which is definitely a mintority voice in X) creates more of an echo-chamber, but I simply can’t stomach being an active user right now.\n\nStill thought it would be valuable to share my results and thoughts in an effort to always leads with transparency.\n\n\n\n\nP.S.

        "content": "When anger rains, leadership reigns no more\n\nLast week, I sat on a panel, & someone hit me with: “What’s the single most important leadership skill to learn?” Without blinking, I said, “\n.” The moderator, clearly in the mood for specifics, leaned in: “Okay, but which emotion?” My answer was swift: “\n.” & here's why.\n\nAnger is the emotional equivalent of a cracked windshield. It doesn’t shatter your vision entirely but distorts it enough to make bad decisions seem reasonable. Neuroscience shows that when you're angry, the amygdala—the brain's fight-or-flight center—hijacks rational thought. This phenomenon is called an amygdala hijack (yes, it's as bad as it sounds)\n\nIn these moments, your prefrontal cortex—the part responsible for logic & decision-making—basically takes a nap. Studies from Harvard suggest that anger impairs your ability to assess risks, communicate effectively, & process information accurately. In short, you’re not the leader they hired—you’re a toddler with a title.\n\n1. Tunnel vision: Anger narrows your focus, so instead of seeing opportunities, you fixate on the problem—or worse, the person causing it.\n\n2. Ego inflation: Anger convinces you that you’re right, even when you’re very, very wrong. Psychologist Martin Seligman calls this the \"rage-blind bias\" where you double down on bad decisions because you’re too heated to consider alternatives.\n\n3. Collateral damage: Anger doesn’t just hurt you—it scorches everything around you. UI research found that leaders who express anger regularly reduce team performance by up to 40%. Imagine being the emotional grenade in your own office.\n\nLet’s not sugarcoat it: anger is inevitable. You’re human, & leadership is stressful. But the goal isn’t to suppress anger—it’s to manage it. Here’s how:\n\n• Name it to tame it: Psychologist Daniel Siegel suggests simply labeling your emotions can calm your brain. The next time you’re seething, try saying (to yourself, preferably), “I’m feeling angry.” This reduces the amygdala’s grip on your brain.\n\n• The 6-second rule: Studies show it takes about 6 seconds for the chemicals triggered by anger to dissipate. Count to 6, breathe, or—if necessary—excuse yourself to scream into a pillow.\n\n• Question your assumptions: Anger thrives on incomplete narratives. Before reacting, ask: “Am I seeing this clearly, or am I just mad?” Spoiler: It’s probably the latter.\n\n• Channel it wisely: Use anger as a motivator, not a weapon. Let it fuel solutions, not vendettas. Turn “I’m furious about this problem” into “I’m energized to fix this problem”\n\nAnger clouds your vision more than any other emotion, turning molehills into mountains & teammates into enemies. As one wise leader once said, \"Anger is like drinking poison & expecting the other person to die.\" Except in leadership, it’s your team that suffers the most. So put the poison down, take a deep breath, & lead with vision—not venom.",

        "content": "DeepSeek has sent shockwaves through the tech world by achieving what was considered impossible in Silicon Valley. \n\nThey've built a reasoning AI model that rivals OpenAI's best, but at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough has erased $2 trillion from the US stock market, with NVIDIA alone losing over $500 billion in market cap. DeepSeek's model cost only $6 million to develop compared to OpenAI's GPT-4, which reportedly cost over $600 million.\n\nWhat makes this a true game-changer is that DeepSeek's model is not only cheaper to build, but also significantly cheaper to run. While OpenAI's models cost over $100 per million tokens, DeepSeek's comes in at under $4. This dramatic cost difference, coupled with the fact that DeepSeek R1 is open source, is causing a major shift in the AI landscape. Silicon Valley's perceived dominance is evaporating as global attention turns to China's AI prowess.\n\nDeepSeek R1 is 27 times cheaper than OpenAI's models, open source with a permissive license, and fully discloses its reasoning steps. This is more than just competition; it's a paradigm shift that has been compared to the \"Sputnik moment\" for AI, signaling a potential new era of AI development where cost and accessibility are revolutionized.\n\nInteresting times!",

Engage, Don’t Just Publish Content\n\nThink of social media as a two-way conversation.\n\nEngage with your audience.\n\nRespond to comments, ask questions, and listen to what people want.\n\nThis helps you activate the platform’s algorithm and the feedback loop helps you refine your offerings.\n\nIf you engage with your followers they will feel seen and heard and invest more time in you.\n\n→ Together you will build your business.\n\n4. Monetize Through Value\n\nStart small.\n\nOffer something that solves a specific problem; an e-book, a course, or a consultation call.\n\nOnce you understand what your audience needs,\n\nyou can expand into subscriptions, done-for-you services, courses, memberships, or collaborations.\n\n5. Stay Lean and Profitable\n\nIt’s tempting to chase rapid growth,\n\nbut in the early stages  cash flow is more important than scale.\n\nFocus on creating a lean operation that serves your clients well\n\nand keeps expenses low.\n\nGrowth will come naturally once you’ve built a solid foundation.\n\nRemember:  Camels are the new unicorns\n\n6. You Don’t Need Complex Strategies and Fancy Tools to Monetize Your Audience\n\nYou have indirect access to 5.5 billion people through the internet.\n\nYou don’t need fancy tools to start monetizing your audience.\n\nStart with the basics.\n\nOnce you’ve established workflows and understand your processes, introduce AI tools to save time and scale.\n\nFrom generating content ideas to automating customer engagement, AI can help you work smarter, not harder.\n\nThe key is to keep it simple at the beginning and scale as you grow.\n\n7. Great Things Take Time\n\nLastly, don’t rush the process.\n\nBuilding something sustainable takes time.\n\nTest different ideas,\n\ngather feedback,\n\nand refine your approach as you go.\n\nFocus on showing up authentically, delivering value, and staying consistent.\n\nOver time, you’ll build not just a business,\n\nbut a community of people who trust and believe in what you offer.\n\nHope you found this helpful.\n\n\n Want more actionable advice like this?
