        "content": "A common complaint that I've heard about coaching programs: \n\nThey're not long enough!\n\nA lot of coaches run three month programs, and although 90 days sounds like a long time, it flies by quickly. Halloween was three months ago, that doesn't seem that long ago does it?\n\nAnd some coaches do six month programs, but they go by quickly too and can leave loose ends when they finish.\n\nThat's why when I was planning my new Natural Born Coaches Program I decided to make it open-ended, meaning that the coaches who join can stay in as long as the program is running.\n\nThat means they get access to all of the programs in it, including new ones launched down the road, and continuing access to the group support calls (even if it's way down the road).\n\nAnd those who join in the initial launch also get 6 monthly 1:1 calls with me to help their progress.\n\nInterested? The next step is to book a call to chat about it at the link in the comments!",

        "content": "The \"dog ate my homework\" has been replaced by \"AI did my homework\". \nThe teachers that demand that students are NOT allowed to use LLMs are shooting their students in the foot. One of my kids had to sign an integrity letter promising they would not use LLMs for school. Dumb. The education system has to change, teaching kids in pre-LLM is equivalent to the stone age for what they need for their future.\n\nIs it cheating? No, not with the right system. The grade curve has shifted, some of you were disliked in school because you ruined the curve. AI is 'ruining the curve'. Imagine a distribution of grade for an essay, written by humans. Now imagine the distribution scored by a naive teacher who doesn't understand AI, the reports all got better and shifted to the right.\n\nFor the lazy students, the procrastinators their position in the curve hasn't changed. If you forgot about your report the night before and right before bed you have an LLM right it... if you're computing/competing against humans you might get a high score 95%. If you're competing against humans using AI, you will get a low score, 60%.\n\nCompare the procrastinator to the student who spent the same amount of time as they might normally spend, 3-5 hours, doing a report. They are doing multiple iterations, their prompting is getting better, their research is going wider, their style is being perfected. They are delivering a paper that in the human world might have received the highest school for the entire district.\n\nStop holding our kids back, stop preparing them for the present when you should be preparing them for the future.\n\nThe main issue is access, kids with access to more expensive LLMs will have an unfair advantage to those who do not. The education system and governments should figure out how to enable all students with great LLM access.",

But failure isn‚Äôt inevitable. Often, it comes down to operational challenges like risk management, task prioritization, cost estimation, and communication, areas that are within a team‚Äôs control. The PMI Toolkit brings decades of expertise to help startups overcome these obstacles with clarity and confidence.\n\nThe toolkit provides practical, evidence-based resources to help founders navigate key challenges:\n Proactive Risk Management: Identifying threats and creating strategies to minimize impacts ensures startups stay ahead of uncertainty.\n Task Prioritization: Aligning efforts with strategic goals, especially with limited resources, drives focus and momentum.\n Accurate Cost Estimation: Building realistic budgets and managing finances is critical to maintaining long-term viability.\n Streamlined Communication: Keeping teams aligned fosters collaboration, minimizes conflicts, and supports effective pivots when priorities change.\n\nBy leveraging tools like these, startups can enhance decision-making, optimize resources, and reduce the likelihood of common pitfalls. The result? A foundation built for scaling and achieving your vision.\n\nAt, we believe in empowering the next wave of dreamers and doers to create real impact. With resources like the PMI Toolkit, the path to startup success becomes not just possible but sustainable.\n\nReady to level up? Dive into these tools and start driving results today. ",

The reasons for a dismissal are not always clear-cut. Often, it is a matter of judgment that can impact the entire team.\n\nDuring the 2014 World Cup, Kevin Gro√ükreutz was mocked for becoming a world champion without playing a single minute. But those who were in the locker room knew how important he was for team cohesion. Just like in a sports team, individual performance is not the only thing that matter, the dynamics and overall performance of a team or department also play a crucial role.\n\nSometimes, a person who is not a top performer still contributes positively to group dynamics. However, if someone consistently falls short of expectations, it can affect the motivation of the entire team.\n\n2. People at the beginning of their careers deserve a second chance. Especially with young professionals, it often turns out that they are better suited for a different role. In my company, I have frequently seen cases where someone was initially hired for a specific position but, after a short time, thrived and was much more successful in a different area.\n\n3. The key question at the end of the probation period.\nWhen the probation period is about to end, I always ask myself:\n\n\"Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person again?\"",

The delegators build empires. The attention-seekers become influencers. The best salespeople change the world. The rule-breakers create new industries. The impatient innovate faster. The bold negotiators earn more. And those who take calculated risks? They're the ones making history.\n\nSometimes extraordinary success means unlearning what we've been taught.\nI learned that through nearly two decades working for Martha Stewart. It was like getting my MBA in personal branding with Professor Stewart; failing wasn't an option.\n\nI learned that excellence isn't just a goal ‚Äì it's a daily practice.\n\nListen to the 7 Lessons I learned at Martha University. A good reminder that breaking the rules is a path that's never crowded.\n_______________\nReady to build a personal brand that breaks through the noise? My Sunday Sunshine readers tell me: your personal brand isn't just important ‚Äì it's everything.\n\nIf you're a high achiever ready to:\n-Turn industry rules into opportunities\n-Transform your expertise into undeniable influence\n-Build a brand that opens doors before you even walk in\n\nLet's talk. I work with select CEOs and leaders ready to think bigger, act bolder, and achieve what others call impossible.\n\nThe leaders who make history don't just break the mold ‚Äì they create a new one.",

A surplus of new speculative office buildings has contributed significantly to elevated vacancy levels.\n\nLeasing Activity Improvement: Despite economic uncertainty, Q4 2024 ended positively with 884,000 square feet leased, contributing to a modest yearly net absorption of 259,000 square feet. However, the CBD recorded a negative absorption of 269,000 square feet.\n\nStable Pricing: Asking rents have remained stable despite elevated vacancies, with the average market rate at $47.45 per square foot. Class A spaces in the CBD lead the market at $65.63 per square foot.\n\nConstruction Slowdown: New office space deliveries have slowed, with 1.9 million square feet under construction, predominantly in the CBD.

If you‚Äôre lucky enough, within just one day of launching, you could be the talk of the world, just like DeepSeek.\n\nThe key is not to panic about competitors or market fluctuations.\n\nFocus on delivering sustainable innovation that solves real problems, backed by a dedicated team, passion, hard work, and a deep understanding of your customers' needs.\n\nThe future is coming fast, and the best way to stay ahead is by creating solutions that truly matter.\n\nAnd if you are a user, please treat every merging tool with precision in testing it and reviewing its policy because hype eventually goes down on projects that are not valuable.\n\nI hope DeepSeek is not just hype, and that it lives up to the sustainable and impactful innovation that can truly help people.",

Yes, I know and agree that tools will be built by senior engineers but tool-users will be business-oriented technical analysts or technical-oriented business analysts.\n\nWith this approach, we will slash process time and reduce the cost to serve. For logistics, this means connect faster, onboard faster and meet customer demands for connectivity with ease. No need for operations to rekey, call and email to get data into the TMS. No waiting on technology team to provision and configure.\n\nBy the way, 1Logtech is a great organization.

        "content": "OOO: Living a dream!\n\nNow that I'm back to reality, I wanted to share a cool experience I had last weekend. Lightning struck twice and I had the incredible opportunity to sing my favorite Brandi Carlile song with the writers themselves: Brandi Carlile, Tim, and Phil!\n\nI truly don't remember the last time I felt such pure joy! I've been reflecting on this experience and what it means as I re-enter exhausting reality. All that comes to mind is gratitude. I'm re-energized and inspired to be creative inside and outside of work. The reason we had so much fun up on the stage is because it was joy & love given and received - there's no feeling like it. I learned a few lessons from everyone I encountered that day, that I wanted to share; apart from improving my public speaking skills by singing to over 2000 folks...\n\nBrandi, Tim, and Phil (and most touring musicians) make working so hard look so easy. The greatest lesson they teach me is in how they share endlessly. It's a good reminder for me. Sharing your thoughts, your skills, your joy, your time, and then seeing the beautiful community you create when you do is an amazing thing. I often have a hard time speaking up or sharing my creativity in or outside of work, I want to keep remembering to share.\n\nTheir crew is a champion of the people. They're excellent listeners, quick on their feet, and the way they can put any performer at ease teaches me that anyone can comfort a stranger and help others succeed. These guys are traveling and working some tough hours and still manage to be the nicest people and want to see you succeed. Supporting your \"performers\" starts with listening, anticipating, and adjusting.\n\nEveryone who supported us from that stage (and back home) made the whole experience. There's truly no feeling or no place else like GJWW with the amount of love and belonging radiating from everyone, I smiled at every stranger I encountered. It teaches me that all you gotta do is ask to connect. Most people want to share about themselves and love learning something about you.\n\nI'm just so positively overwhelmed; If this is a community that can rise together and hold each other, how do I take that feeling with me into everyday? It'll take conscious effort but it's not hard to be kind, to take a moment to remember what's important, protect your neighbors and coworkers, to share your joy, and hope it brings others along.\n\nAnyway, the most important lesson I learned is to put yourself out there. You never know what may come of it...like meeting your heroes.",

Also, I'll share ideas how I fixed some of this. \n\nScenario: Someone is working for you in whatever role. You (Chris / I ) get ideas. I send those in Text, Email, Slack, etc.. and don't provide context. In my mind, it's a \"hey, this is an idea we should do sometime, just documenting.\" BUT, usually how people read it is \"Shit... do I do this now? Later? I feel pressure.\"\n\nSometimes that pressure builds up and causes issues without me even knowing, however it was my fault.\n\nWhat I have started doing is reviewing priority lists weekly. I also will document my ideas and go over them at an appropriate time. ALSO, I added in a Tiered system of communications like \"R1 = Request lowest level, not urgent\" \"R2 = Request, somewhat urgent, client or customer.\" and \"R3 = URGENT, client and customer\". Possibly R4, doomsday situation.\n\nIt's not a perfect system. I'm no master. I am learning and these little things have helped improve workflows with others a lot.\n\nHow have you worked on your management or commutation skills?",

        "content": "Why I Recommend Avoiding JWT ? and Alternative Authentication Solutions\n\nIn my experience working with various web and mobile applications, I‚Äôve come to realize that while JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is widely popular, it isn‚Äôt always the best choice. Here‚Äôs why:\n\n1. ùóñùóºùó∫ùóΩùóπùó≤ùòÖùó∂ùòÅùòÜ ùó∂ùóª ùóßùóºùó∏ùó≤ùóª ùó†ùóÆùóªùóÆùó¥ùó≤ùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅ\nManaging JWTs can become tricky, especially as your app scales.
