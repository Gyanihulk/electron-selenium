The project will invest $500 billion into AI development in the United States, creating over 100,000 jobs and focusing on building massive data centres and other critical AI infrastructure. Unclear how the project will be funded and by whom but its expected over the next four years.\n\nThe initiative aims to bolster America‚Äôs technological leadership and accelerate progress in healthcare, particularly through advancements like cancer detection and personalised vaccines using AI. Trump emphasised energy production and regulatory support to expedite the project. The leaders expressed confidence in the U.S. under Trump‚Äôs leadership, calling it the beginning of a \"golden age\" for America",

      "content": "Protection against cyber attacks requires a multi-layered approach that combines technical defenses, user awareness, and proactive monitoring. One of the foundational steps is implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to filter malicious traffic and monitor for suspicious activity. Additionally, encryption should be used to protect sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to attackers. Regular software updates and patching are crucial to fixing vulnerabilities that could be exploited in an attack.\n\nAnother key aspect is user education‚Äîtraining employees on recognizing phishing scams, using strong passwords, and following best practices can reduce the risk of social engineering attacks. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional verification, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access. Moreover, organizations should implement backup strategies to ensure critical data can be restored in the event of a ransomware attack or data breach. Finally, continuous monitoring of networks and systems can help detect and respond to potential threats in real time, minimizing the impact of an attack. By integrating these measures, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce their exposure to cyber threats and strengthen their overall security posture.\n\n Stay connected for industry‚Äôs latest content ‚Äì Follow",
