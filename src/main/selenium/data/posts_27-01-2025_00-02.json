      "content": "2015 post series, number 16...\n\nThis post will be about the majority of the emails and LinkedIn outreach that I get. For lack of a better term, I will use the term\nto describe this group.\n\nThe company I run and those that I have worked with have used this tool in the past from a variety of companies. Haven't found one that works yet. All of these groups claim to have solved the cold outreach issue. using their software, technique, technology, they can increase the amount of \"qualified leads\" and turbocharge the efforts of your sales team.\n\nI have no doubt that there are companies that do this, do this with advanced software, and have a formula that takes the sales funnel and drastically increases the number of targeted sales calls a company takes, ultimately increasing sales and revenue more cheaply than the age-old technique of a salesman using the yellow pages and a rolodex. Ok, I am old enough for thePages reference, not really the rolodex reference, but giving it a go anyway.\n\nThe issue is this is textbook white noise. There are so many companies that do this now--and many that just resell a service that someone else does, that it is next to impossible to review all of their products. My team could spend weeks simply vetting them all, and honestly, all of the products claim to do something incredibly similar. Because there are so many companies that claim to do this ultimately after trying and failing with one it is next to impossible and illogical to try another source.\n\nHas anyone found one that works? Would love to hear it. I trust the referral more than the 5 emails and messages I have received today.\n\nOh, and next post will be about the podcast interview requests...",

When a client leaves, when an idea doesn’t work, when the challenge feels like too much. But trust me on this, it’ll push you in the direction you’re meant to go.\n\n- That client who left? It’ll make space for the ones who actually value what you do.\n\n- The idea that flopped? It’ll teach you more about what doesn’t work than any win ever could.\n\n- The challenge you didn’t see coming? It’ll give you the resilience to handle anything.\n\nSetbacks aren’t the end, they’re redirections. Most of the time, they lead to breakthroughs you didn’t even realise you needed.\n\nSo, if you’re going through it right now, just keep moving. You’ll look back and realise it all made sense in the end.",

      "content": "You don’t have to be based in a thriving metropolis to build a thriving business. As entrepreneur Sumit Sinhal has discovered, sometimes the most promising opportunities lie in overlooked places.\n\nThe founder of Kins Health, a growing healthcare company in West Bengal, India, Sinhal chose to build his business in Siliguri, a small town nestled between Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. As Kins brings cutting-edge health care to underserved and hard-to-reach communities, Sinhal aims to harness the power of digital technology to reach patients wherever they are, from their workplaces to their homes.\n\nSinhal has discovered that success in remote markets requires building more than just a business. \"Businesses do not exist in isolation,\" he notes. \"When you're working in a resource-limited setting, you have to build everything over time\" — from infrastructure to employee mindset, elements that might come ready-made in major cities.\n\nLooking ahead, Sinhal sees technology as key to scaling impact. \"I think our company and healthcare as an industry is at an inflection point,\" he says. His vision includes creating \"docpreneurs\" — helping doctors become digitally-savvy business owners who can expand healthcare access in other remote areas. \"If it can work here, it can possibly work at a lot of other places as well.\"\n\n\nGrit & Growth is a podcast from @Stanford Seed in which entrepreneurs from emerging markets share their stories, and faculty and business experts offer insights.",

Having worked deeply with financial systems, including PayPal, I understand how money operates daily. In traditional systems, governments hold editing privileges, allowing them to create more money as needed, increasing the ‘error’ in this system.\n\nCryptocurrency challenges this by providing transparency, decentralization, and a new vision for control and value. It’s a step toward reshaping how we perceive and interact with money.\n\nWhat do you think about the role of crypto in the future of finance?\n\n\n\nYour repost could spark meaningful discussions.

This significantly surpasses earlier estimates of around 100 million, making it \"the largest medical data breach in US history.\"\n\nHow did it happen? In short, the breach exploited a compromised account lacking multi-factor authentication and used compromised credentials on Citrix remote-access software to gain unauthorized access.\n\nThis resulted in a reported $872 million financial impact and 6TB of sensitive data exfiltration. And there is a lot of personal health info exposed. A lot.\n\nWho's behind it? Black Cat ransomware group, who scammed the affiliate “Notchy” (who conducted this breach) pocketing the ransom payment without paying their share.\n\nIn response, the affiliate collaborated with RansomHub, attempting to extort Change Healthcare further, but no additional payments were made, leaving the stolen data in cybercriminals’ hands.",

      "content": "DeepSeek's r1 model release caused quite a stir in the AI community, yielding a lot of good and bad takes.\n\nFirst thing out of the way - it is not a PsyOp or fakery, it is a good model created by a talented team of researchers with a lot of small innovations, especially on efficiency side. The fact that it is released under an MIT license with a nice research paper is also a shift - it is by far the strongest (mostly) open source model for a while.\n\nThe most interesting thing for me about what they write in their paper is how well reinforcement learning (RL) is working. The coolest thing is all of the emerging behaviours (i.e. not explicitly selected for by researchers) that these models start to exhibit after all the RL training:\n\n- Reflection: The model spontaneously rechecks and reevaluates steps mid‐solution.\n- Self‐Correction: It spots mistakes and fixes them on the fly (e.g. incorrect factorisation).\n- Aha Moments: It learned to pause, say “Wait,” and re‐start with a fresh chain.\n- Longer outputs: It learned that longer outputs can yield better results\n- Language Mixing: It can blend multiple languages or code snippets, since it only cares about getting the right final answer, not readability for humans.\n\nAll these behaviours happened without humans explicitly teaching these techniques. This only came from rewarding the correct answer.\n\nThe readability is a very interesting point. The original R1-Zero model was trained on pure RL and its 'thinking' was not comprehensible for researchers. If a model performs extremely well but 'thinks' in a completely incomprehensible way for humans, would we be ok with this kind of model? Perhaps forcing it to only 'think' in a single language (e.g. English) would limit how well it can 'think'. If it learned a concept in Chinese or Hebrew, would it be forced to avoid it for our convenience?\n\nTo get to DeepSeek R1, they trained the base v3 model on some initial examples of the 'correct' chain of thoughts, which taught the model to think in a single language (mostly) and format chains of thought correctly.\n\nAnd the last very cool finding was that you can train smaller models on the reasoning chains (incl. 1.5b model) and increase their performance dramatically.\n\nAll and all, this is a very interesting model and more importantly paper. This tells us what likely OpenAI (and others) are already doing and how impressive RL can be.",

      "content": "Code rewrites and restructures are super important and sometimes time taking, having done it at FamPay, I’ve learnt a lot about it, but let’s break down how Pinterestdid it for their ads platform.\n\n\n\nWe see ads everywhere, and one of Pinterest’s major revenue sources is its ad platform, which delivers >$3B in yearly revenue.\n\n\nBut it is both that straight forward, their original way had a lot of problems.\n\nPinterest's original ad-serving system, \"Mohawk,\" implemented in 2014, became complex over time, leading to:\n\n- Lack of modularization\n- Unsafe multi-threading\n- No guarantees of data integrity\n- Close coupling of infrastructure and business logic\n\nThese issues resulted in frequent outages and significant engineering hours spent on maintenance, which is not really good for anyone.\n\nTo address these challenges, Pinterest's Ads Infrastructure team developed AdMixer, a Java-based platform that handles ad-serving tasks, designed to integrate smoothly with Pinterest’s other systems. It ensures that multiple ad-related tasks are executed safely and efficiently across Pinterest's vast ecosystem.\n\nThe design principles included:\n\n- Easily extensible with flexible frameworks and APIs\n- Modular, separating infrastructure and business logic\n- Safe-by-design, ensuring safe concurrent programming and data integrity\n- Developer-friendly, with tools that increase development speed\n\nThe Result:\n\nSince its deployment, AdMixer has achieved:\n\n• No significant outages for almost 3 quarters, even during the holiday season.\n• Delivered 2+ billion ad impressions daily and generated $2.8B in revenue.\n• NPS jumped from 46 to 90.\n• Supported hundreds of millions of users globally across 30+ countries.\n• It comprises more than 380,000 lines of code and over 200 experiments by more than 100 engineers.",

Boosters are enamored with the rev gen sports, and those are nearly all male (but this is shifting with the rise of women’s pro sports). The result is that deals abound for top tier athletes in those sports.\n\nIf there is a solution it lies in companies like- because those deals are based on\nNIL. Influencers in general weigh heavy female. Content creation is key and female athletes hold significant advantages that often make them better influencers.\n\nBrands, do your homework. Universities will literally come begging for you to source your marketing through their female athletes. Guys likeat Florida already know this and are sourcing insane deals for those women.\n\nGet on the bus or it will leave the station without you.",

Heavily invested.\n\nThe Gates Foundation? Same story.\n\nSometimes their investments directly conflict with their missions.\n\nImagine an environmental nonprofit unknowingly profiting from oil companies.\n\nOr a social justice group tied up in private prisons.\n\nIt happens. A lot.\n\nNonprofits are no longer just donation-driven organizations.\n\nThey’re businesses.\n\nSmart ones are building endowments, investing surplus cash, and looking for ways to fund their missions sustainably.\n\nMany nonprofits invest passively, chasing returns without considering the real impact of their portfolios.\n\nIf you’re a nonprofit (or advising one), this is where the game changes.\n\nThe Numbers:\n\n74% of U.S. nonprofit endowments invest in the stock market (Commonfund).\n\nOnly 13% of nonprofits say their investments fully align with their mission (USSIF).\n\nThat’s a gap. And it’s costing them more than just credibility.\n\nWhat Smart Nonprofits Do Differently\n\nThey Align Investments With Their Mission\n\nIf you fight for climate action, invest in renewable energy, not fossil fuels.\n\nTools like ESG funds and SRI (Socially Responsible Investing) criteria make it easy to avoid conflicts.\n\nThey Leverage Impact Investing\n\nInstead of just chasing returns, invest directly in companies or funds that drive measurable social outcomes.\n\nExample: Back startups solving water scarcity if that’s your cause.\n\nThey Use Transparency as an Advantage\n\nTell your donors: “Here’s where your money is invested, and here’s the impact it’s making.”\n\nTransparency builds trust. Trust builds loyalty.\n\nThey Treat Endowments Like Fuel, Not Treasure\n\nADon’t hoard. Put your money to work. A smart portfolio can fund today’s operations and tomorrow’s growth.\n\nMy Advice?\n\nNonprofits need to stop thinking like charities and start thinking like changemakers with capital.\n\nEvery dollar invested can serve two purposes:\n\nFinancial returns to keep the organization alive.\n\nMission-aligned impact that accelerates the cause.\n\nStop playing defense. Start investing smarter.\n\nWith purpose and impact,",

      "content": "Your life could change overnight simply by making different choices...\n\nHere are 10 choices that'll change everything:\n\n1. Claim Accountability for Everything\n\nYou can either be the victim...\nOr you can be the hero.\nBut you can't be both.\n\nChoose wisely.\n\n2. Level Up Your Network\n\nNo prizes are given for being the smartest person in the room.\n\nEvery room reverts to the mean.\n\nWhich means you only ever get pulled up...or dragged down.\n\nThe easiest way to level up in life is to spend more time with people ahead of you on the journey.\n\n3. Cultivate Daily Discipline\n\nI hate writing, but love having written.\nI hate working out, but love having worked out.\nI hate eating healthy, but love having eaten healthy.\n\nYou don't have to love the process...Do it anyways.\n\n4. Turn Your Weakness Into A Strength\n\nI used to blame my ADHD for being the reason I was failing in life.\n\nIt was an easy scapegoat.\n\nThings didn't start turning around until I went on a quest to master my biology and turn ADHD into a super-power.\n\n5. Creat More. Consum Less.\n\nIt's very hard to get paid for collecting dots.\n\nSurprisingly easy to get paid connecting them, though.\n\n**Dots = Information\n\n6. Treat Personal Development Like A Full-Time Job\n\nSkills are the only investment that pay compounding interest regardless of economic conditions.\n\n7. Build a Business\n\nHustle is the motor.\nOpportunity is the vehicle.\n\nDoesn't do any good to strap a gigantic motor onto a row-boat.\nAlternatively, a paddle doesn't do ya much good on a yacht.\n\nPairing the right hustle with the right opportunity is essential.\n\nWhich is why it's very hard to get rich as a W2 employee.\nWrong vehicle.\n\n8. Ask Better Questions\n\nHere's one of the best questions I started asking myself:\n\nSo What?\n\nOnce you realize that other people's perception of you...\n\nOr their hate...\n\nOr their boos...\n\nCan't actually stop you...\n\nThen you become something terrifying to the trolls and well meaning loved ones who would hold you back...\n\nUntouchable.\n\n9. Do More. Think Less.\n\nA lack of knowledge has almost never been the thing that's held me back in life...\n\nIt's been a lack of execution.\n\n10. Learn Higher Value Skills\n\nYou're paid in proportion to the magnitude of the problems you solve.\n\nIt hurt my ego to admit I wasn't very valuable to the world.\n\nBut it was true.\n\nI didn't have the ability to solve any meaningful problems.\n\nMy life didn't really change until my SKILLS changed.",
