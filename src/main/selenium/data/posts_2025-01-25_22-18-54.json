AI texts may be generated elsewhere and re-typed, so you can make some automation slower, not remote the AI-generated content publishing, unless you introduce a witness, which is impractical.\n\nThere may be no way to detect or limit AI content publishing, and it is 97% unlikely that you will make a serious profit from AI unless you're a big tech corporation.
