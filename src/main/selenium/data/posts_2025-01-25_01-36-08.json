Sometimes we overcomplicate things trying to be \"perfect.\"\n\nSo I simplified it all down to:\nEMAILS → TASKS → REPEAT\n\nWhy? Because:\n• Emails generate tasks\n• Tasks drive action\n• Actions create results\n• Results lead to more emails\n\nAnd the cycle continues... \n\nThe power of crafting the perfect schedule has never worked for me.\nThe power is in simplicity!\n\nSometimes the best productivity hack is just focusing on the basics and letting everything else fall into place.",

After he interviewed with the client:\n\nThe feedback I got from them was very disappointing. \"Your applicant presented himself very well and seems qualified, but 5 years OFF is a long time, we can’t take that RISK.\"\n\n“OFF”? He had taken the “break” to sit on his backside and watch The Office reruns with the occasional a nap. In addition, he was also doom scrolling TikTok. He did not hide this on his resume. He wrote \"professional sabbatical to unwind.\"\n\nAND he explained all of this during the job interview.\n\n“RISK”? This is an excellent candidate who kept his skills up to date. Yet all my client could see was the gap. A gap in employment history should not discount someone’s abilities.\n\nShouldn't a GAP in employment be expected at some point in one's career? If a candidate has the right skills and attitude to do the job, shouldn’t that be enough?\n\nYou see nonsense job and career related posts like this on LinkedIn everyday.\n\nFor no-nonsense job and career related content, check out my newsletter by hitting the ‘View My Blog’ link at the top of this post.",

Self-care and extended Sabbaticals aren’t appreciated in corporate and/or hustle cultures.\n\nTaking 5 years off has no less risks than someone who has a 5-week gap in my opinion.\nIt shows that the person is self-sufficient and not desperate to take on any role; some employers might feel uncomfortable with that.\nIt also shows that they have their s%+it together because not many people can financially afford to not work for 5 years.\nI also see a person with infinite appetite to work and create and get their hands dirty without carrying old baggage or stress from a previous employer.\n\nBest of luck to your client. If they are persistent and well qualified they will surely find a better match!",
