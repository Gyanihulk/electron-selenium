It is some of the most cold-hearted and inhumane actions I’ve seen.\n\nThe intent is not to improve, it is to set up a termination for when they return. It is to retaliate against the employee for taking extended paternity leave. A benefit the company offers but don’t you dare take them up on the entirety of their generous benefit.\n\nI know it sounds hard to believe, but I have personally spoken to way too many new fathers who have experienced it to consider it an outlier.\n\nThe PIP is often out of the blue, undeserved, and unachievable. The stress it causes the employee, his pregnant wife, and their unborn child is outrageous and harmful.\n\nFor what, to be able to justify terminating the employee when they come back from leave because they were already on a PIP before they left.\n\nGenerous benefits are great until you fully utilize them and your manager does not support it. I'm not telling people to not take paternity leave, just assess the culture and mindset of the organization and its leadership when doing to.",

He told him that he was leaving for the Philippines for two weeks and wanted to take out a loan of $5,000. The bank employee responded that the bank would need a form of security for the loan.\n\nThe man handed over the keys to a new Ferrari parked on the street in front of the bank. The inspector checked the numbers and everything and agreed to accept the car as collateral.\n\nOfficials laughed at the guy who kept a $250,000 Ferrari as collateral for a $5,000 loan.\n\nThe Ferrari was parked in the bank's underground garage. Two weeks later the guy came back and repaid the $5,000 plus interest, which totaled $15.41.\n\nThe bank's loan officer said, “Sir, we were very happy about this deal, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked and discovered that you are a millionaire. What's the point in you worrying about a $5,000 loan?\n\nThe millionaire replied: “Where else in New York can I park my car for $15.41 for two weeks? \"\n\nThe rich always stay rich because they know a lot more about money management than ordinary people.

But let’s get real—if Dr. King were alive today, he’d be furious.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause all these years later, Black homeownership rates are as bad or nearly as bad as they were in 1968—the year the Fair Housing Act was passed:\n\nSixty years later, and we’re still watching Black and Hispanic families get shut out of the #1 wealth-building tool in America..\n\nThis system isn’t broken—it’s working exactly as it was designed to.\n\n Black and Hispanic borrowers are denied mortgages at nearly TWICE the rate of white applicants—with the same income and credit scores.\n Those who do get approved are often charged higher interest rates, adding up to tens of thousands of dollars lost over the life of a loan.\n Even the algorithms—the so-called “neutral” automated underwriting systems (AUS)—are coded with bias, disproportionately rejecting minority applicants.\n Let’s talk home insurance—a Black family buying a home in a historically redlined area often pays more for insurance than a white family in a similar financial situation.\n\nYou want to build wealth? Too bad—the system is rigged.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: Black buyers are told that if they just \"fix their credit,\" \"save more,\" and \"work harder,\" they’ll get the same shot.\n\n That’s a lie.\n\nThis isn’t about “bad credit” or “financial literacy.” This is about decades of systemic discrimination that keep Black and Brown families locked out of homeownership—and locked out of generational wealth.\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nWe stop playing nice. We start demanding accountability.\n\n Lenders—Audit your underwriting models. If bias exists (and let’s be honest, it does), FIX IT.\n Regulators—Get some backbone. Enforce anti-discrimination laws like lives depend on it—because they do.\n Realtors & loan officers—Stop just “doing your job” and start advocating for change. If you see discrimination, CALL IT OUT.\n\nSilence is complicity.\n\n The dream of homeownership shouldn’t be a privilege—it should be a right. But rights mean nothing without action.\n\nDon’t just remember Dr. King today. Honor him by fighting for real change.",

A weapon.\n\nSomething that can be used for good or mass evil.\n\nYou pick it up and see your lock screen 100 times per day.\n\nUse it to your advantage.\n\nPlace your creed and your transformation on it.\n\nYou’ll burn it into your brain.\n\nYou’ll behave like you already have it.\n\nYou’ll stop at nothing to get it.\n\nThis is prime real estate. It’s not for fun.\n\nThis is what will become of your life.\n\nBelief + reps = everything.\n\n---\n\nShare your phone background in the comments.\n\nOr follow me for more →\n\nIf you do both, you delay global warming by 1000 years.",
