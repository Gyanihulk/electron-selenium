      "content": "Adding notes to connection requests is a bad idea.\n\n(people accept such requests way less). Here's why:\n\n1. Most notes are generic with no clear value.\n\n“We share X connections”, “want to add you to my network”, \"want to grow...\"\nIf they accept the request -> those notes turn into DMs they must deal with.\n\n2. People accept almost every connection request without a note.\n\n- Yet a few accept every request with a note.\n- In my personal experience, it's more effective to:\n\n1. Send connection request without notes\n2. Engage with the person's content a few times\n3. No content? See if they comment on others' posts.\n4. Wait for the opportunity to start a conversation in the DMs.\n\nUnless…\n\n3. You can add a highly customized note (personalized + relevant)\n\nA note that can’t be copy+pasted to another person:\n\n “would love to add you to my network”\n Top-25 sales execs in 2024! Are you the first one from Woodpecker to do it?\n\nPoor note = get ignored.\nAmazing note = a conversation starter.\n\nWhat’s your take on this topic?\n\nPS.

𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\n\n Are your prospect details verified and up-to-date?\n\n- thoroughly research your prospects\n- focus on mobile numbers + mark verified numbers\n- Use tools liketo enrich and verify your lead data.\n\n𝟮. 𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆\n\n Are you mentally prepared and focused, ready to handle rejections positively?\n\nAdopt this mindset:\n\n\"I approach each call as a new opportunity to learn and connect, keeping my objectives clear and staying adaptable throughout the conversation.\"\n\n→ Each call is a win.\n\n𝟯. 𝗗𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆\n\n Have you set up your workspace to maximize efficiency during your call sessions?\n\n- Use dialers to organize your calls efficiently.\n- Your CRM should give you the option to dial with one click.\n- Open 30 tabs in your browser (=next calls)\n- Time block 30-90minutes with regular 5min breaks\n- Use times when you have the highest energy.\n\nIs your focus on quantity or quality?\n\nThe truth is: you need both.\n\n𝟰. 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿\n\n Is it clear, concise, and does it feel natural to you?\n\nIt’s about finding what works for you.\n\nTry it out at least 100 times before you move on.\n\nWithout giving your opener enough time to work, you’ll be lost.\n\n𝟱. 𝗧𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 & 𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲\n\n Are you experimenting with trying different paces, volumes, and tones?\n Standing up or sitting upright to project confidence?\n Smiling while you speak?\n\nDon’t forget: tonality and tempo are key. Work on this daily.\n\nThat doesn’t always mean being very upbeat.\n\nA relaxed, friendly tone works well.\n\n𝟲. 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴\n\n Are you responding to cues during the conversation?\n Are you using their information to ask deeper questions?\n\nMake sure your solution can help - qualify them.\n\nDon’t waste your time with interested non-buyers\n\nSave the pitch for later meetings. Your only job: book the meeting.\n\n𝟳. 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\n\n Have you accepted rejection as part of the game?\n\nEach \"No\" you receive isn't personal - it's simply business.\n\nStay positive.\n\n𝟴. 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀\n\n Are you taking a moment to jot down everything?\n\nDo it right after the call.\n\nNo matter how minor it may seem.\n\nP.S. What's your best cold calling tip?",

      "content": "I saw a recent post regarding salaries and thought this was a great piece of information to share as I frequently speak to Consultants who mainly aim to receive higher salaries.\n\nUnderstandably a higher salary can certainly be appealing, but it’s not the only factor that leads to happiness or fulfillment. Here’s why:\n\n\n\n𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤-𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: A high salary can come with long hours, stress, and burnout. Prioritizing work-life balance and spending time with family or pursuing hobbies is vital for mental and physical well-being.\n\n𝐉𝐨𝐛 𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Doing work you love or can bring a sense of purpose, even if the paycheck isn’t as big. Feeling fulfilled in your role and having a sense of contribution can outweigh financial rewards. In addition to this, a higher salary will comes with more expectations, whereas starting on a lower salary with room for you to enhance your base and commission will buy you time to build your knowledge.\n\n𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡 & 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬: A job that is less demanding on your time and energy often leads to better overall health. High-paying positions sometimes come with high stress levels, which can have a detrimental impact on your well-being in the long run.\n\n𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡: Sometimes the best opportunities for growth come from taking risks, learning new skills, and challenging yourself in areas beyond money. A position that offers personal development can be just as valuable as financial compensation.\n\n\n𝐈𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦 𝐠𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐚 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬, 𝐥𝐞𝐭'𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭!",

Earning more will always be better and provide the person with better/greater opportunities in the future. For instance, when one is looking to get financing to buy a house. The bank wont care if you walk 6 mins or commute 1h and the numbers will play a big part in determining how much can be borrowed.",
