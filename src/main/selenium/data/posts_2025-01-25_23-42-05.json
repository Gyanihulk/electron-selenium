We Got in the Same Room, Regularly:\nWe met often, face-to-face, to discuss what’s working and what’s not. We were respectful, transparent and honest. We took the iron sharpens iron approach in our meetings. Was there friction, YES! Did we come out of those meetings aligned, YES!\n\n2. We Stopped the Blame Game:\nWe had common goals and were rowing in the same direction to achieve those goals. We owned the revenue number together with shared incentives and accountability.\n\n3. We Walked a Mile in Each Other's Shoes:\nMarketing attended sales calls; sales reviewed marketing content early in the development process.\n\n5. We Fixed the Feedback Loop:\nSales gave timely feedback, and marketing adjusted strategy accordingly. A CRM helped but we were careful that it didn't replace face to face feedback opportunities.\n\n6. We Ditched the Jargon and Got Real:\nWe focused on what the customer cared about, not internal terminology.\n\n7. We Made Data Useful, Not Just Pretty:\nWe used data to make decisions, not just fill reports. We aligned on key data and reports and relentlessly fought against REPORT CREEP!\n\n8. We Celebrated Wins Together:\nWe had a mechanism in place to recognize each other's contributions to success. Every team member could celebrate another. This one is extremely important.\n\nFixing misalignment takes action, not talk. What’s worked for you? Any tools or processes you've used? Share your thoughts!",

      "content": "Today \n#CyberTalent spotlight is on Annie Audic\n\nWhat was your original career path and how did you end up in the cyber security field?\n\nI started my career in Paris at L’Oréal as a researcher in chemistry and then worked in the photobiology department to study the oxidative stress on DNA caused by sunlight. My position also involved international publications and patents. In the pharmaceutical industry, I became R&D Project Director at Jouveinal, then I worked in business development with the teams Sigmatau (Italy), UCB (Belgium), Nippon Shinyaku (Japan), Jouveinal INC (Canada). Then I was the director of a Regional Center for Innovation and Technology Transfer in the field of health and biotechnology in Rennes, Brittany, and led an ecosystem of 70 research units and 150 companies.\n\nIn 2006, I joined the Brittany Region to develop and implement the higher education, research and innovation policy within the general management of the economy, and to manage and supervise the research, innovation and Europe departments. The most significant focus marked the implementation of programs dedicated to satellite technologies and uses, which have been a biotechnologies growth lever for Brittany. In 2014, the President of the region entrusted me with the mission of setting up a Cyber Security Center of Excellence with the Ministry of Defense, and it was created in 2018. From the outset, we have worked on our ecosystem at the regional, national, and European levels.\n\nℹ️ What is the most appealing thing to you about working in cyber security?\n\nThe novelty, a market to create, driving innovation in a constrained, complex world, the need to work on knowledge (research), education (training and behaviour), and the economy at the same time at the three levels: regional, national, and European.\n\n Name a book/movie that has inspired you. Anything specific to cyber security that you would recommend?\n\nTwo books that have nothing to do with each other but that speak of other worlds, that of the androids and the pirates!\n\nPhilippe K. DICK, “Do androids dream of electric sheep?”\n\nBernard SIMIOT, “Ces messieurs de ST Malo\n\n\n I recommend you to follow her , like and comment on this post to share her example, and perhaps suggest others to showcase !\n\n>>> This profile is part of a series I’m publishing every other day in collaboration with @Women4Cyber Foundation, follow me to receive the next updates.",

India and China have mastered the art of doing more with less.  From ISRO’s Mars mission (at just 1/10th the cost!) to platforms like UPI, they’ve proven time and again that cost-efficiency and innovation go hand in hand.\n\nMeanwhile, in the West, innovation tends to come with a hefty price tag —high labor costs, expensive materials, pristine infrastructure. But here’s the exciting part: the future of AI isn’t just for the big spenders.\n\nAsput it, teams around the world will “run the DOGE for AI” —embracing scrappy, distributed, and imperfect infrastructure to build incredible things. This isn’t cutting corners; it’s creative problem-solving and smart optimization.\n\nDeepSeek R1 is a perfect example of this trend—and it’s exciting to think about what it signals for the democratization of AI. \n\nWhat’s your take? Have you seen examples of resourceful innovation in your region or industry? Let’s start the conversation.",

But don’t worry, it’s not all doom and gloom—I’ve got solutions too.\n\nWhy Lead Scoring is Failing You:\n️ Outdated Methods – Scoring based on job title or company size? That’s so 1999.\n️ No Intent – Leads ignoring your emails shouldn’t score high. Period.\n️ Zero Personalization – One-size-fits-all scoring doesn’t work anymore.\n️ Data Overload – Tons of data, but no real insights.\n\nSo, What’s the Fix?\nIt’s not magic—it’s AI.\nAt, we’ve built AI agents that integrate seamlessly with Salesforce to take the guesswork out of lead scoring. They prioritize intent, personalize the process, and analyze behaviors to ensure your team focuses on leads that actually close.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\nTraditional lead scoring is broken. Let’s fix it.\nWatch the video to see how you can stop chasing dead ends and start converting with confidence. Got questions or horror stories about outdated systems? Drop them in the comments—let’s fix this together.\nAnd remember: Guessing doesn’t close deals, systems do.",

You may have actually stumbled into the best situation possible by starting in 2021. Here’s the deal. . . the financial services business is notoriously slow to evolve and implement technology, so for a long time they made it difficult to do business online. My company started doing all our business online in 2014 and it was brutal because the companies didn’t know how, but the pandemic accelerated this out of necessity. Not only that, but building your business utilizing technology and social media and doing meetings primarily through video conferencing rather than in person meetings is a far more efficient and effective way to build a practice/business.",

Embrace robust red-teaming and safety testing metrics.\n\n• Strategic Vision: Cultivate a boardroom culture of trend-spotting and strategic sense-making. Align AI initiatives with business goals and market dynamics.\n\nCritical AI Governance Checklist:\n Explore all strategic AI options (Closed vs. Open Source LLMs)\n Ensure digital and cyber literacy at the board level\n Prioritize governance, organizational design, and technological capabilities\n Drive responsible growth through informed digital transformation\n\nThe differentiator?
