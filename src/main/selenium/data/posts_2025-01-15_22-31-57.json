Our team is one of them.\n\n* The founders have a rolodex of clients in this industry.\n\n* We already have a product and early customer validation.\n\nWhat could be some of the wrong answers?\n\n* Our team is young. We can build anything and we can sell anything.\n\n* Our customers raise money. So, if they can do it, we can do it.\n\n* We have worked with each other in the past. So, we enjoy working together.\n\nThis mindset allowed me to raise my seed fund 3 years back, and we're still benefiting from it.\n\nWhat are your favorite Q&A during fundraising?",

You barely acknowledge your family or friends because you're consumed with finding a job that pays the bills. A new position becomes your Great White Whale and you turn into a pathological Ahab on the hunt to find it.\n\nWith every attempt, you get oh so close, only for the oceanic beast to dive deep in the murky water and taunt you with its escape.\n\nFoiled again.\n\nLaying in bed at night, you torture yourself replaying the game over and over again wondering what more you could have done and how you need to try something new tomorrow.\n\nSeemingly, nothing works and you're nothing more than a life raft bobbing on vast expanse of a job market which only wants to swallow you and drown your once promising career.\n\nThere isn't much more that you can be doing.\n\nBut, you try, you compete and, ultimately, you fail. Day after day for months and years on end. You want to give up, but the moment you stop paddling, the game up is up.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing. It isn't fun and, at times, it feels cruel and an unfair. Those are the shakes.\n\nYou don't have to like it, you just have to survive it.\n\nBELIEVE IN YOURSELF AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IN YOU!",
