Not everyone is ready for the AI revolution.\n\nWhat hidden revenue is your business missing? If you had this opportunity, would you seize it?",

Here‚Äôs some feedback to improve things for \nhashtag\n#franchisors\n1) Your business IS a technology biz.\n2) Don‚Äôt let franchisees ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù - give them specific terms on what tech they will use.\n3) Do all the locations have back up Internet so you‚Äôre never down?\n4) Do all your locations have consistent customer experience on the phone? They need a consistent tech stack.\n\nWe‚Äôve served a 1,400 store brand and streamlining their tech operations saved them 40% of costs and dozens of hours/month in administration.\n\nI suggest a technology is as important to your franchise package as the logos, recipes or other processes.

By being real, we invite others to do the same.\n\nLeaders who embrace vulnerability create trust, break down barriers and build a culture where growth and healing happen. It‚Äôs in this space that we stop pretending everything‚Äôs perfect, learn from our mistakes and foster deeper connections.\n\nBy talking openly about our struggles, we normalise seeking help, reducing the stigma around mental health at work.\n\nVulnerability shifts the conversation, making it a strength, not a weakness and gives others the courage to do the same.\n\nLet‚Äôs embrace vulnerability. It heals, connects and creates a workplace where growth can thrive.",

The Q4 2024 data shows a significant resurgence, with total investments reaching $62.2 billion‚Äîa 57% increase from the previous quarter and the highest since Q1 2022.\n\n AI's Dominance ‚Äì AI continues to be the top investment priority, with four major AI deals accounting for $26.6 billion in Q4 2024, over 60% of total VC investments last quarter.\n\n Sector Focus: IT Takes the Lead ‚Äì In 2024, IT captured nearly half of all VC investments, significantly outpacing other sectors. Funding for IT was more than twice that of health and life sciences, five times greater than consumer goods and services, and almost ten times higher than energy. This heavy concentration of capital in AI and emerging technologies underscores investor priorities.\n\n Fewer Deals, Larger Investments ‚Äì While total VC funding is rising, the number of deals has dropped significantly, falling below 10,000 for the first time since 2012. This signals a shift in investor priorities, with capital concentrating on AI and emerging technologies, making it more challenging for legacy companies to secure funding. Startups should focus on innovation and differentiation to stand out in this competitive landscape.\n\n Geographic Trends ‚Äì The San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Boston continue to dominate in VC funding, but emerging tech hubs like Austin, Miami, and Los Angeles are seeing increased investor attention. Startups in these regions should leverage local ecosystem advantages.\n\n VC Market Surges, But Deals Decline ‚Äì Venture capital investment soared to over $180 billion in 2024, marking a 27% increase from 2023. However, despite this growth, the number of deals dropped below 10,000 for the first time since 2012. This trend suggests that investors are becoming more selective, concentrating capital into fewer, high-potential startups‚Äîespecially in AI and emerging technologies. For founders, this means that while funding is available, competition is tougher than ever, making differentiation and strong business fundamentals essential.\n\nRead the full EY report here:\n\nWhat‚Äôs your take on these trends? How is your startup adapting to this evolving VC landscape? ",

(Note: I‚Äôm not sure how much of that is true - it‚Äôs one person‚Äôs opinion. Also my understanding is that Taiwan is the ‚ÄúIsrael of Asia‚Äù, with many strong high-tech SMB ventures..)\n\nI joked to her that Korea has an opposite problem. Koreans - the ‚ÄúItalians of Asia‚Äù - are taking too much risk, as it seems everyone and their mother are buying meme coins these days :)\n\nJokes aside - some countries or companies (especially big, stable companies) are more risk averse, while their leaders often try to imbue more sense of risk-taking and entrepreneurship.\n\nI think it comes down to a simple fact - if the potential downside of risk taking is bigger than the potential upside, people become risk averse. For example, if a company has a surefire cash cow business that‚Äôs printing money, how many teams would want to try launching a new project at the risk of potentially hurting the cash cow business?\n\nThat is, unless they have a full endorsement from the management that any short-term negative implications (\"the downside\") will be tolerated, while the team will participate in any potential upside.\n\nIf leaders want their organizations to become more risk-taking, they should think about how to reduce the potential downside and increase the potential upside for their risk-taking squad.",

In January alone, Apple exported iPhones worth Rs 19,000 crore, beating the previous monthly record of Rs 14,000 crore set in December 2024.\n\nThis rapid surge is largely due to the assembly work done by three major suppliers‚ÄîFoxconn, Tata Electronics, and Pegatron‚Äîunder India‚Äôs production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme.\n\nThe introduction of the iPhone 16 in October 2024 further boosted exports, with monthly figures consistently exceeding Rs 10,000 crore since the device‚Äôs launch.\n\nRead the full story here:",

        "content": "On the courses I run I sometimes hear that the Agile Manifesto doesn‚Äôt always define other practices and methodologies that are said to be ‚ÄòAgile‚Äô. And that is true. When it was created the people involved tried to take core commonalities from ideas like Scrum, XP, Kanban etc and create four values. They did this so they would be a useful guideline for others. But is there a way of writing a more ‚Äòcatch all‚Äô general manifesto.\nLet‚Äôs think about it.\nIndividuals and Interactions over Processes and tools is basically saying let people make decisions and trust them to do so. Allowing them to pivot quickly rather than slowly due to a set workflow. Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation is doubling down on this point from a stakeholder context. Quick feedback mechanisms rather than a set menu. Working together rather than ordering. Responding to change rather than following a plan reinforces this even more with a subtext of ‚Äòwhat‚Äô is being made is more important than ‚Äòhow much‚Äô of it has been completed. And finally working software over extensive documentation which again dovetails into these other ideas by implying that it is better to make something and get early opinions on it rather than trying to specify it to the nth degree.\nSo I‚Äôd like to suggest a kind of ‚ÄòBig Agile‚Äô manifesto, that doesn‚Äôt change the original but lives around it in a macro way. Much like the first manifesto did for the myriad of ideas that had sprouted since the fifties:\n‚Ä¢ Assumption over Investigation\n‚Ä¢ Trust over Control\n‚Ä¢ Listening over Directing\n‚Ä¢ Outcome over Output\nThe added bonus of this is because it has distance from the Agile manifesto is that it can serve as a check for a process you are using that you think is Agile.\nSo let me know what you think about this more generalised set of values. Is it useful or not and is there something that I have missed ?",

        "content": "Here's the basics of how to do your outreach...\n\nStart with a solid list of the folks you want to build a relationship with. Because that's what it is about. Not constantly pitching people.\n\nReach out with thoughtful and strategic messaging to connect and engage.\n\nIn this example, your CTA is a Zoom call (everybody's online now so yippee for that!)\n\nOn that very 1st Zoom, don't pitch out of the gates. Be curious about them. Ask genuine questions about their business. Make sure the questions are designed to enlighten you on where you will be able to provide help.\n\nBe sure to have a follow up next step and make that happen. This next step is all about continuing to build rapport and adding value. Part of your pipeline management process.\n\nAs you engage with more and more prospects, have a process to gather emails and get them into your distribution platform. Then nurture all of your connections with targeted content that is designed to help them in some way.\n\nRemember, as you talk to prospects, 90%+ will be long term leads. You will not convert them right away. This is normal. So you must stay close to them and nurture while you are asking for the business.\n\nCraft a master lead list that you are updating along the way. This keeps you focused on WHO is in your pipeline and what needs to happen to move people forward.\n\nWant to get 1 on 1 with me? Text GIANTHELP to 650-459-2712\n\nWait!

They‚Äôre not just walking bundles of I need tips. They‚Äôre actual humans with feelings, frustrations, and emotional baggage that don‚Äôt magically go away after reading a checklist.\n\nLet me paint you a picture\n\nSay you‚Äôre a fitness coach. Sure, your audience wants tips on how to lose weight or build muscle, but you know what‚Äôs really keeping them up at night?\n\nThey‚Äôre staring at their reflection, feeling like they‚Äôve let themselves go.\n\nThey‚Äôre embarrassed to show up at the gym because they think everyone‚Äôs judging them.\n\nThey‚Äôre tired of being the friend who‚Äôs always on a diet but never sees results.\n\nWhere‚Äôs that content?

Share the tips. But mix it up. Call out the messy middle‚Äîthe frustrations, the fears, the sleepless nights.\n\nSpeak to their ultimate desires, too:\n Confidence.\n Freedom.\n Finally feeling at peace with where they are.\n\nWhen you start creating content that hits both their minds AND their hearts? That‚Äôs when your brand becomes unforgettable.\n\nBecause tips and tricks are cool‚Ä¶ but showing people you truly understand them? That‚Äôs magic.\n\nPS: Be truthful, how many tips and tricks do you share per week?\n\nI build the best personal brands with content ‚ÄºÔ∏è Ready to stand out? Let's talk!",

Whether it‚Äôs good publicity or embarrassing publicity‚Äîpublicity is publicity.\n\nA sense of humor is essential in this space.
