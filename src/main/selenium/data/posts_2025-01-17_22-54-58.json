Playing it safe rarely drives transformative results.\n\n3️⃣ 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿-𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆: These leaders deeply understand their customers, innovating and delivering value that meets real needs.\n\n4️⃣ 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗡𝘂𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁: Growth is a team sport. Building and empowering the right people is non-negotiable.\n\n5️⃣ 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗥𝗶𝗴𝗼𝗿: Ideas are easy; execution is everything. Discipline in execution sets growth leaders apart.\n\nThis framework isn’t just theoretical—it’s actionable. In my experience, these mindsets serve as a roadmap for leaders in any industry, whether you're scaling a startup, driving innovation through AI and automation, or navigating transformation in a legacy enterprise.\n\n𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗡𝗼𝘄\n\nIn a time where 𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘆, 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗺𝗯𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻; 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺.

This is not just about theory—it’s a proven driver of results.\n\nAsk yourself: Do your growth priorities align with customer needs? Are you empowering your team with the tools, skills, and autonomy to excel?\n\n𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:\n\nIf you’re a leader (or aspire to be one), take a moment to reflect:\n\nWhich of these mindsets are already strong for you?\nWhich need more focus in 2025?",

They both require a different focus and perspective.\n\nI know some fantastic entrepreneurs who are also building amazing communities.\n\nBut they are not the same thing.\n\n\nBuilding a business is:\n\n- for you\n- revenue focussed\n- team centred\n\n\nBuilding a community is:\n\n- for them\n- ‘feeling’ focussed\n- relationship centred\n\n\nFrankly, in this day and age the fastest way to grow your business is to build a community. And this is where some people get a little confused.\n\nSTOP selling, START sharing.\n\nIn other words, build a community that loves you and the rest will follow. This requires commitment to others. It requires you to be selfless. It requires you to sometimes put someone else before your own goals for a change.\n\nTHIS is what community really means.\n\nAnd it’s also what distinguishes a good personal brand, from a GREAT one.\n\nSo get building.\n\n(This is something I’m going to be able to help you with very soon )\n\n\nWhat are your best tips for building a strong community? Let me know in the comments!\n\n\nP.S on that note, I’m forever grateful for this growing community on LinkedIn (over 20k of you now!)
