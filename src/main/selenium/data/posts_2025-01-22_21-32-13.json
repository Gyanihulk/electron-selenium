      "content": "$500 Billion Investment in AI! Here is the Rest of the Story. The year was 1986. We did the deal that launched Masayoshi Son and Softbank into Mega Success. As a young General Counsel of Novell, one of my first deals was with Mr. Son for the distribution of Novell's NetWare into the Japan market. I remember Mr. Son being a fun guy, full of energy, and wickedly smart. All of this before he became a global figure and the biggest investor in Stargate- the new AI Infrastructure play announced yesterday by Trump and Mr. Son (along with Ellison and Altman). In the 1980s, Mr Son was a budding entrepreneur and wanted to become a Distributor for us. While Novell eventually declined in prominence, Masayoshi Son used the momentum from that early partnership to build SoftBank into a global powerhouse, investing in transformative technologies and startups. The Novell-Son relationship remains a testament to the power of recognizing and capitalizing on emerging technologies ...now like AI!",

You can’t force change on someone who isn’t willing.\n\nBut you can change your environment to surround yourself with people who inspire, challenge, and support you.\n\nWhether it is in business or life, the people around you play a huge role in your growth and happiness.\n\nChoose them wisely.",
