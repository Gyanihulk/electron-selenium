For all the effort the Indian government is putting into being competitive in the AI race, key players in the ecosystem are behaving differently. Bhavish has kept patriotism at the forefront of a vast majority of his business proceedings yet doesn't utilise his platform to boot Indian made AI Models. \n\nThis is also a big hit to the US with Deepseek entering one of the biggest AI markets in the world at such low cost. I'm keen to see how the Trump Administration respond - wouldn't be surprised if treaties are signed sometime soon giving a much needed boost to both economies.\n\nAt the same time, we might see an increase in FDI relating to AI from the west in response to fears of loosing foothold in the Indian market.\n\nIf India are able to grow quickly in the facilitation of AI, establishment of datacenters and supporting technology, I believe we will be able to achieve the growth targets set out by PM Modi.

Farewell to this chapter, but not to the incredible people.\n\nBig Lessons:\n1. Opportunities present themselves if you just show up.\n\nI remember being in awe of Josh Matthews (still am). I had been a loyal listener of his weekly Clubhouse show back in like 2021 because it had the best advice for folks trying to break into a\ncareer. I absolutely SQUEE-ED when he asked me to co-host. Being engaged really helped to get me connected. I've learned so much and am so grateful for the platform he extended to me. I am so incredibly proud of what we've done, the people we've supported, and the friendship (and friend group!) we've build around the show.\n\nAnd with Clicked -- I thought I was going to be a pretend stakeholder like for one skills challenge... who knew I would enjoy role playing so much that I would still be doing it years later?!\n\n2. Throw away the self limiting beliefs. Sometimes you just don't know what you're capable of yet.\n\nMe in 2020: \"I am not a content creator lol\"\nMe in 2025: \"So I have a podcast, I write articles, I am working on an online course, I am speaking at TDX..\"\n\nI guess I just needed someone else to see it in me first ‚ÄçÔ∏è\n\nGrateful toandfor the amazing platforms and seeing more in me than I saw in myself. Grateful for all the learners and listeners that let me be a part of their journeys. Grateful for all the friends I've made along the way (,,,to name a few).\n\nThis is maybe more of an evolution than a permanent goodbye though...

It belongs to a thousand competing priorities.\n\nBut what if the day was a success before the first decision hit your inbox?\n\nThis is where the AM bookend comes in.\n\nThe most effective CEOs are intentional about their mornings.\n\nInstead of being pulled into chaos, they craft a structured start from a place of focus and clarity.\n\nHere‚Äôs how:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Start with Stillness\n Before diving into the external world, take a few moments for yourself. Meditation, breathwork, or even a moment of silence can create spaciousness in your mind before the demands of leadership take over. Even just five minutes of deep breathing can shift your state dramatically.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Move Before You Consume\n Instead of reaching for your phone first thing, reach for movement. Stretch, walk, or engage in some form of physical activity to wake up your body and energize yourself naturally. The most effective CEOs know that peak performance isn‚Äôt just mental, it‚Äôs physical, too.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Plan With Intention\n Clarity doesn‚Äôt come from reacting; it comes from choosing where to place your energy. Before checking email, define your top priorities for the day. What‚Äôs the one thing, if completed, that would make today feel meaningful? Decide and do that first.\n\nBy implementing an AM bookend, you take ownership of your day before the world takes it from you.\n\nWhat‚Äôs one small change you‚Äôve made to your morning routine that‚Äôs had the biggest impact?\n\n Followfor more.\nÔ∏è Repost to share the mindfulness",

        "content": "We‚Äôve reached peak chatbot hype. Now what?\n\nChatGPT, Bard, Claude‚Äîthese tools have sparked endless excitement, reshaped workflows, and even reimagined entire industries. But here‚Äôs what no one‚Äôs talking about: their limitations.\n\nRecent research suggests we‚Äôre running up against some fundamental walls. Large Language Models, for all their brilliance, aren‚Äôt infinite wells. They struggle with reasoning, context retention, and‚Äîironically‚Äîlearning from their own mistakes.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just about \"hallucinatory\" answers or quirky outputs. It's about scalability, reliability, and trust. As businesses lean harder on AI, these cracks become harder (and more expensive) for organizations like ours‚Äîbuilders, integrators, and adopters‚Äîto ignore.\n\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\n‚Üí Realigning expectations: Chatbots weren‚Äôt meant for everything. Instead, they thrive on narrow, well-defined tasks.\n‚Üí Hybrid approaches: Pair AI with human oversight. Machines scale; humans refine. Together, they deliver.\n‚Üí Investing differently: Less on hype, more on infrastructure. Think robust datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, and ethical guardrails.\n\nWe‚Äôre not at an end. We‚Äôre at an inflection point.\n\nAI isn‚Äôt magic‚Äîit‚Äôs math. And like any tool, its value lies as much (or more) with how we use and adapt as with its design.\n\nWhat‚Äôs your take? Are we ready for this next phase? Are you seeing this in your development and research?\n\nFor more, check out Quanta‚Äôs deep-dig here:",

Master controlled breathing - before your brain spirals.\n‚Ü≥ The 4-7-8 method disrupts fight-or-flight mode.\n‚Ü≥ Activates the vagus nerve, instantly lowering stress.\n\n2. Reframe pressure - stress is fuel in disguise.\n‚Ü≥ Top performers reframe stress as excitement ‚Äì HBR.\n‚Ü≥ Your brain follows the meaning you assign it.\n\n3. Start your day with non-negotiables.\n‚Ü≥ Your morning dictates your confidence baseline.\n‚Ü≥ A 15-minute ritual grounds your nervous system.\n\n4. Use power posing - it‚Äôs science, not fluff.\n‚Ü≥ Expands testosterone, shrinks cortisol in 2 minutes.\n‚Ü≥ Harvard study: It boosts confidence in risk-taking.\n\n5. Proximity shapes beliefs - confidence is contagious.\n‚Ü≥ Your circle shapes your mindset ‚Äì choose growth.\n‚Ü≥ Mirror neurons make mindsets highly transferable.\n\n6. Embody ‚ÄòFuture You‚Äô - act before you feel ready.\n‚Ü≥ Ask: What would the confident me do?\n‚Ü≥ Action rewires your brain faster than affirmations.\n\n7. Speak in shorter sentences - your brain loves it.\n‚Ü≥ Overcomplicated speech breeds doubt\n‚Ü≥ Concise speakers are perceived as more confident.\n\n8. Stop over-praising others - it signals lower status.\n‚Ü≥ Too much admiration can weaken your confidence.\n‚Ü≥ Confident people acknowledge, not over-elevate.\n\n9. Hold eye contact 1 second longer than normal.\n‚Ü≥ It projects certainty and commands respect.\n‚Ü≥ Breaking eye contact too soon signals insecurity.\n\nConfidence isn‚Äôt magic - it‚Äôs a trained response.\nWhich one do you use?

Despite reporting $44.6 million in revenue for FY24, the company anticipates a massive jump to $143.3 million in the current fiscal year, signaling its rapid growth trajectory in the cloud and data services industry.\n\nWith a valuation of $4.2 billion, Yotta is positioning itself as a key player in India‚Äôs AI ecosystem, supplying over half of the advanced chips acquired by the Indian government under its AI Mission.

Efficiency benefits vanish when enough compute/data is available.\n3. Distillation cannot produce lower cross-entropies when enough compute/data is available.\n\nWe investigate this, and many other facets of distillation in detail in the paper.\n\nThis investigation answered many long-standing questions I‚Äôve had about distillation.

Perform a GAP analysis to identify differences between GP and NetSuite.\n Outline Migration Goals: Define your objectives beyond replacing an end-of-life system. Consider goals like improved reporting, streamlined processes, and enhanced scalability. Establish KPIs to measure success.\n Assemble a Cross-Functional Team: Involve stakeholders from IT, finance, operations, and other departments. Develop a communication plan to keep everyone informed about the migration timeline and progress.\n Gather Business Requirements: Plan customizations in NetSuite to match your business processes, including workflows and approval processes, ensuring NetSuite meets your specific needs.\n Develop a Training Plan: Provide comprehensive training for all users with manuals, video tutorials, and ongoing support to help them adapt to the new system.\n\nWith careful planning and the right implementation partner, your migration to NetSuite will be smooth, predictable, and successful.

They implement feedback insanely fast.\n‚Ü≥ Instead of taking weeks, they apply what we teach in hours or days.\n‚Ü≥ They don't make excuses as to why something wasn't done.\n‚Ü≥ They have no pride and learn everything with humility.\n\n2. They are scared of failing - but they do it anyway.\n‚Ü≥ The best founders see failure as just part of the process.\n‚Ü≥ They don't internalize their failures - they just learn from them.\n‚Ü≥ They understand that if they fail faster, they move faster than everyone else.\n\n3. They experiment with their offer & pricing OFTEN\n‚Ü≥ They are constantly trying new pitches, offers, packages, payment plans.\n‚Ü≥ They don't believe that they have had their best idea yet.\n‚Ü≥ They understand that building is an everlasting process.\n\nThis month, I'm meeting 1-on-1 with any coach, consultant or Founder that sends me a DM.\n\nAs long as your business is:\n‚Ü≥ Already generating revenue\n‚Ü≥ You have over 1,000 followers on LinkedIn\n‚Ü≥ A coaching, consulting or service-based offer\n\nAnd you have a big lofty goal for 2025.\n\nSend me a message and we'll create a strategy together.",

That my work should speak for itself.\n\nBut if I‚Äôm being honest, it wasn‚Äôt just about the work. I was avoiding being seen.\n\nI was scared of being seen.\n\nMaybe you‚Äôve felt this too.\n\n‚Üí You want to put yourself out there, but you second-guess every post.\n\n‚Üí You hesitate to share a photo or post a video because you don‚Äôt like how you look.\n\n‚Üí You feel like you don‚Äôt have anything valuable to say, so you stay silent.\n\nI kept thinking, What if no one cares?\nWhat if I say the wrong thing?\nWhat if I just don‚Äôt belong in this space?\n\nSo, I stayed in the background. I helped others build their brands, create content, grow their visibility, while I remained invisible.\n\nThen one day, I realised:\n‚ÄúHow can I tell people to show up if I‚Äôm not doing it myself?‚Äù\n\nSo I posted. I shared my insights, my work, my thoughts, even when it felt uncomfortable.\n\nAnd you know what happened?\n\nNothing bad. No one called me out. No one asked me to stop.\n\nIn fact, people actually responded.\n\nNot because I had all the answers. Not because I was perfect. But because I showed up.\n\nSo if you‚Äôve been waiting for the perfect moment, the perfect words, the perfect version of yourself: ‚Äústop waiting.‚Äù\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to be polished to be valuable.\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to be an expert to have something worth saying.\n\nYou don‚Äôt need permission to take up space.\n\nYou just need to ‚Äústart‚Äù.\n\nBecause\nSomeone out there is waiting for your voice, your insights, your perspective.\n\nThey don‚Äôt need you to be perfect. They just need you to be you.\n\nThe world will never know what you have to offer unless you stop hiding.\n\nSo here‚Äôs your sign: Post the thing. Share your thoughts. Take up space.\n\nYou matter. You are enough. And the world needs to hear from you.\n\nWhat‚Äôs one fear that‚Äôs kept you from sharing your voice or showing up online?",

Here are some key techniques to help you get the most out of your SQL queries:\n\n ùó†ùó∂ùóªùó∂ùó∫ùó∂ùòáùó≤ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùó®ùòÄùó≤ ùóºùó≥ ùó™ùó∂ùóπùó±ùó∞ùóÆùóøùó± ùóñùóµùóÆùóøùóÆùó∞ùòÅùó≤ùóøùòÄ\n\nWildcard characters can be handy, but they can also slow down your queries. Use them sparingly and only when absolutely necessary to improve query speed.\n\n ùóúùóªùó∞ùóøùó≤ùóÆùòÄùó≤ ùó§ùòÇùó≤ùóøùòÜ ùó£ùó≤ùóøùó≥ùóºùóøùó∫ùóÆùóªùó∞ùó≤ ùòÑùó∂ùòÅùóµ ùóúùóªùó±ùó≤ùòÖùó≤ùòÄ\n\nIndexes are crucial for speeding up query performance. They help the database find and retrieve data faster.\n\n ùó®ùòÄùó≤ ùóîùóΩùóΩùóøùóºùóΩùóøùó∂ùóÆùòÅùó≤ ùóóùóÆùòÅùóÆ ùóßùòÜùóΩùó≤ùòÄ\nChoosing the right data type for your columns is essential for optimizing performance. Use data types that best represent the data and ensure they are as specific as possible.\n\n ùóîùòÉùóºùó∂ùó± ùó¶ùòÇùóØùóæùòÇùó≤ùóøùó∂ùó≤ùòÄ\n\nSubqueries can be resource-intensive and slow down your queries. Whenever possible, use joins instead of subqueries to improve performance.\n\n ùó®ùòÄùó≤ ùóüùóúùó†ùóúùóß ùóºùóø ùóßùó¢ùó£ ùòÅùóº ùóüùó∂ùó∫ùó∂ùòÅ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùó°ùòÇùó∫ùóØùó≤ùóø ùóºùó≥ ùó•ùóºùòÑùòÄ ùó•ùó≤ùòÅùòÇùóøùóªùó≤ùó±\n\nWhen you only need a subset of results, use the LIMIT (MySQL) or TOP (SQL Server) clause to limit the number of rows returned.\n\n ùóîùòÉùóºùó∂ùó± ùó®ùòÄùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùó¶ùóòùóüùóòùóñùóß\n\nUsing SELECT * retrieves all columns, which can be unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, specify only the columns you need to reduce the amount of data retrieved.\n ùóòùó´ùóúùó¶ùóßùó¶ ùóúùóªùòÄùòÅùó≤ùóÆùó± ùóºùó≥ ùóúùó°\n\nThe EXISTS clause is generally faster than the IN clause, especially when dealing with large datasets. Use EXISTS to check for the existence of a record in a subquery.\n\n ùó®ùòÄùó≤ ùóöùó•ùó¢ùó®ùó£ ùóïùó¨ ùòÅùóº ùóöùóøùóºùòÇùóΩ ùóóùóÆùòÅùóÆ\n\nThe GROUP BY clause is useful for aggregating data and can help improve performance when used correctly.\n\n ùó®ùòÄùó≤ ùó¶ùòÅùóºùóøùó≤ùó± ùó£ùóøùóºùó∞ùó≤ùó±ùòÇùóøùó≤ùòÄ\n\nStored procedures are precompiled and can execute faster than individual SQL queries. They also help with code reuse and maintainability.\n\n ùó¢ùóΩùòÅùó∂ùó∫ùó∂ùòáùó≤ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóóùóÆùòÅùóÆùóØùóÆùòÄùó≤ ùóóùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùó¥ùóª\n\nA well-designed database schema can significantly improve performance. Normalize your database to eliminate redundancy and ensure that your tables are appropriately indexed.\n\n ùó®ùòÄùó≤ ùó§ùòÇùó≤ùóøùòÜ ùó¢ùóΩùòÅùó∂ùó∫ùó∂ùòáùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùóßùóºùóºùóπùòÄ\n\nTake advantage of query optimization tools provided by your database management system. These tools can help you identify performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements.\n\n ùó†ùóºùóªùó∂ùòÅùóºùóø ùó§ùòÇùó≤ùóøùòÜ ùó£ùó≤ùóøùó≥ùóºùóøùó∫ùóÆùóªùó∞ùó≤\n\nRegularly monitor the performance of your queries to identify and address any issues. Use performance monitoring tools to track query execution times and optimize as needed.",
