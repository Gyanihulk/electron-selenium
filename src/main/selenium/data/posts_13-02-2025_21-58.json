While I’ve had plenty of viral content, one thing has become clear—most platforms don’t pay fairly for it.\n\nThe reality is, it takes a rare breed to build a social network. Founders and CEOs of social platforms understand the key metrics (KPIs) that drive engagement and growth. Whether it’s good publicity or embarrassing publicity—publicity is publicity.\n\nA sense of humor is essential in this space. Social networking isn’t just about technology; it’s about keeping people engaged. Whether you’re running a massive platform or just getting started, grabbing attention matters.\n\nSo, lighten up. Laugh a little. And enjoy the ride.\n\n(Harry Bōlz might agree.)",

For all the effort the Indian government is putting into being competitive in the AI race, key players in the ecosystem are behaving differently. Bhavish has kept patriotism at the forefront of a vast majority of his business proceedings yet doesn't utilise his platform to boot Indian made AI Models. \n\nThis is also a big hit to the US with Deepseek entering one of the biggest AI markets in the world at such low cost. I'm keen to see how the Trump Administration respond - wouldn't be surprised if treaties are signed sometime soon giving a much needed boost to both economies.\n\nAt the same time, we might see an increase in FDI relating to AI from the west in response to fears of loosing foothold in the Indian market.\n\nIf India are able to grow quickly in the facilitation of AI, establishment of datacenters and supporting technology, I believe we will be able to achieve the growth targets set out by PM Modi.

Sometimes you just don't know what you're capable of yet.\n\nMe in 2020: \"I am not a content creator lol\"\nMe in 2025: \"So I have a podcast, I write articles, I am working on an online course, I am speaking at TDX..\"\n\nI guess I just needed someone else to see it in me first ‍️\n\nGrateful toandfor the amazing platforms and seeing more in me than I saw in myself. Grateful for all the learners and listeners that let me be a part of their journeys. Grateful for all the friends I've made along the way (,,,to name a few).\n\nThis is maybe more of an evolution than a permanent goodbye though... I’m looking forward to collaborating with+ the newcrew and joining future episodes of the Salesforce Career Show as a guest!",

It belongs to a thousand competing priorities.\n\nBut what if the day was a success before the first decision hit your inbox?\n\nThis is where the AM bookend comes in.\n\nThe most effective CEOs are intentional about their mornings.\n\nInstead of being pulled into chaos, they craft a structured start from a place of focus and clarity.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n1️⃣ Start with Stillness\n Before diving into the external world, take a few moments for yourself. Meditation, breathwork, or even a moment of silence can create spaciousness in your mind before the demands of leadership take over. Even just five minutes of deep breathing can shift your state dramatically.\n\n2️⃣ Move Before You Consume\n Instead of reaching for your phone first thing, reach for movement. Stretch, walk, or engage in some form of physical activity to wake up your body and energize yourself naturally. The most effective CEOs know that peak performance isn’t just mental, it’s physical, too.\n\n3️⃣ Plan With Intention\n Clarity doesn’t come from reacting; it comes from choosing where to place your energy. Before checking email, define your top priorities for the day. What’s the one thing, if completed, that would make today feel meaningful? Decide and do that first.\n\nBy implementing an AM bookend, you take ownership of your day before the world takes it from you.\n\nWhat’s one small change you’ve made to your morning routine that’s had the biggest impact?\n\n Followfor more.\n️ Repost to share the mindfulness",

        "content": "We’ve reached peak chatbot hype. Now what?\n\nChatGPT, Bard, Claude—these tools have sparked endless excitement, reshaped workflows, and even reimagined entire industries. But here’s what no one’s talking about: their limitations.\n\nRecent research suggests we’re running up against some fundamental walls. Large Language Models, for all their brilliance, aren’t infinite wells. They struggle with reasoning, context retention, and—ironically—learning from their own mistakes.\n\nThis isn’t just about \"hallucinatory\" answers or quirky outputs. It's about scalability, reliability, and trust. As businesses lean harder on AI, these cracks become harder (and more expensive) for organizations like ours—builders, integrators, and adopters—to ignore.\n\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\n→ Realigning expectations: Chatbots weren’t meant for everything. Instead, they thrive on narrow, well-defined tasks.\n→ Hybrid approaches: Pair AI with human oversight. Machines scale; humans refine. Together, they deliver.\n→ Investing differently: Less on hype, more on infrastructure. Think robust datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, and ethical guardrails.\n\nWe’re not at an end. We’re at an inflection point.\n\nAI isn’t magic—it’s math. And like any tool, its value lies as much (or more) with how we use and adapt as with its design.\n\nWhat’s your take? Are we ready for this next phase? Are you seeing this in your development and research?\n\nFor more, check out Quanta’s deep-dig here:",

Master controlled breathing - before your brain spirals.\n↳ The 4-7-8 method disrupts fight-or-flight mode.\n↳ Activates the vagus nerve, instantly lowering stress.\n\n2. Reframe pressure - stress is fuel in disguise.\n↳ Top performers reframe stress as excitement – HBR.\n↳ Your brain follows the meaning you assign it.\n\n3. Start your day with non-negotiables.\n↳ Your morning dictates your confidence baseline.\n↳ A 15-minute ritual grounds your nervous system.\n\n4. Use power posing - it’s science, not fluff.\n↳ Expands testosterone, shrinks cortisol in 2 minutes.\n↳ Harvard study: It boosts confidence in risk-taking.\n\n5. Proximity shapes beliefs - confidence is contagious.\n↳ Your circle shapes your mindset – choose growth.\n↳ Mirror neurons make mindsets highly transferable.\n\n6. Embody ‘Future You’ - act before you feel ready.\n↳ Ask: What would the confident me do?\n↳ Action rewires your brain faster than affirmations.\n\n7. Speak in shorter sentences - your brain loves it.\n↳ Overcomplicated speech breeds doubt\n↳ Concise speakers are perceived as more confident.\n\n8. Stop over-praising others - it signals lower status.\n↳ Too much admiration can weaken your confidence.\n↳ Confident people acknowledge, not over-elevate.\n\n9. Hold eye contact 1 second longer than normal.\n↳ It projects certainty and commands respect.\n↳ Breaking eye contact too soon signals insecurity.\n\nConfidence isn’t magic - it’s a trained response.\nWhich one do you use?

Despite reporting $44.6 million in revenue for FY24, the company anticipates a massive jump to $143.3 million in the current fiscal year, signaling its rapid growth trajectory in the cloud and data services industry.\n\nWith a valuation of $4.2 billion, Yotta is positioning itself as a key player in India’s AI ecosystem, supplying over half of the advanced chips acquired by the Indian government under its AI Mission. The company has already deployed 4,000 GPUs and is set to activate another 2,000, despite high capital expenditures. While Yotta currently projects a net loss of $113 million for FY25, its long-term vision and aggressive expansion strategy could make it a game-changer in the global data infrastructure landscape\n\nRead the complete article to know more.

Let’s break down why this X-integrated AI tool is turning heads (and memes).\n\n First Impressions\n\n• Clean Interface: Minimal design, swipe-left history, and a bottom search bar. No clutter, perfect for new users.\n• Missing Haptics: No tactile feedback yet (unlike ChatGPT), but updates are expected.\n• Web/Mobile Sync: Works seamlessly across devices.“The app is so simple, even your grandma could meme with it.” \n\nImage Generation Freedom \n\n• Zero Copyright Filters: Create branded images (Tesla in a desert? Done ), political figures, or hyper-realistic scenes—no restrictions.\n• Meme Whisperer: Explains viral memes better than Gemini/Claude. “Finally, an AI that gets my Gen Z humor!” \n\nX (Twitter) Superpowers:\n\n• Profile Summaries: Instantly vet users’ credibility with AI-generated bios.\n• Post Analysis: Tap the  icon on any tweet for context (perfect for decoding niche debates).\n• Direct Publishing: Share Grok’s answers as X posts in one click.\n\nPricing & Perks \n\n• X Premium+ Bundle: $16/month nets you:Unlimited Grok accessAd-free X + premium featuresPriority updates.\n• Free Tier Limits: 10 queries/2hrs, 3 image analyses/day. “Great for casual users, but heavy lifters need Premium.\n\n️ Pros vs. Cons\n\n Pros:\n• Real-time X data integration\n• Uncensored creativity\n• Ethical creator payouts via X’s Partner Program\n\n Cons:\n• iOS-only app (for now)\n• Quota resets feel stingy vs. ChatGPT\n\n Benchmark Beast\n\nGrok-2 dominates in:\n• Visual Math: 69% on MathVista (beats GPT-4o!)\n• Doc Understanding: 93.6% on DocVQA\n• Coding: Competes closely with Gemini 2.0“It’s not just a chatbot—it’s a STEM tutor in disguise.” \n\n Should You Try It?\n• For X Addicts: A no-brainer—Grok’s social integration is unmatched.\n• For AI Purists: Wait for Android/web expansion.\n• Meme Lovers: Worth the free tier alone. \n\nDrop a ️ if you’re signing up!\n\n Final Take\n\nGrok isn’t perfect, but its social-first approach and X synergy make it a must-test. Whether you’re crafting viral threads or solving equations, it’s the AI sidekick you never knew you needed.\n\nTry the free version → [Link] Agree? Let’s debate in the replies!\n\nFollow @AI_Insider for more deep dives. ",

But here’s a tough question: Can your business thrive without you?\n\nIf the answer is no, then you don’t just own a business—you own a demanding job that depends entirely on you. And that comes at a cost:\n\n Lower Business Value – Owner-dependent businesses sell for much less.\n No Personal Freedom – You’re always on call, stuck in daily operations.\n Stunted Growth – Without systems & leadership, scaling becomes impossible.\n Increased Risk – A single emergency could put everything in jeopardy.\n\nThe solution? Shift from being indispensable to being scalable.\n\n Build a leadership team that thinks like owners.\n Document processes—make your expertise part of the business, not just in your head.\n Develop an exit strategy—options give you leverage, even if you’re not leaving soon.\n Empower your team to own client relationships.\n\n The ultimate test? If you can step away without the business missing a beat, you’ve built something truly valuable.\n\nStart small. Pick one area, systematize it, and delegate. Your business deserves to be an asset, not just a job.\n\n Read the full blog and take the first step toward long-term business success:",

Our distillation scaling law shows, well, it's complicated...\n\nIn short, compared to supervised training:\n1. It is only more efficient to distill if the teacher training cost does not matter.\n2. Efficiency benefits vanish when enough compute/data is available.\n3. Distillation cannot produce lower cross-entropies when enough compute/data is available.\n\nWe investigate this, and many other facets of distillation in detail in the paper.\n\nThis investigation answered many long-standing questions I’ve had about distillation. I am deeply grateful for my amazing collaborators,,,, and, whose expertise and support brought this project to life.\n\n Dive into the details:\n- Paper:\n- A quick Twitter explainer:",

Consider goals like improved reporting, streamlined processes, and enhanced scalability. Establish KPIs to measure success.\n Assemble a Cross-Functional Team: Involve stakeholders from IT, finance, operations, and other departments. Develop a communication plan to keep everyone informed about the migration timeline and progress.\n Gather Business Requirements: Plan customizations in NetSuite to match your business processes, including workflows and approval processes, ensuring NetSuite meets your specific needs.\n Develop a Training Plan: Provide comprehensive training for all users with manuals, video tutorials, and ongoing support to help them adapt to the new system.\n\nWith careful planning and the right implementation partner, your migration to NetSuite will be smooth, predictable, and successful.

Highlighting the massive AI investments by the US ($500 billion) and China ($100 billion), he stressed that India cannot afford to lag behind. However, instead of competing on sheer scale, Paras advocated for a smarter approach—focusing on brainpower, creativity, and leveraging open-source AI models.\n\nDrawing from real-world examples like Cocoro 82 and Sony AI’s diffusion model, he showcased how highly efficient AI systems can be built with minimal resources. He urged Indian researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to invest in AI talent, infrastructure, and cutting-edge research to develop world-class models. With the right strategy, he envisions India as a global AI powerhouse, driving innovation and shaping a multipolar AI future where advanced technology is accessible to all.",

Hard.\n\nThis is just one of the surprising truths about AI-assisted coding:\n\n1️⃣ Senior engineers benefit more than beginners. This is the opposite of what we expected. AI is a multiplier, but if you lack strong fundamentals, it multiplies confusion.\n2️⃣ AI-generated code can be a house of cards. It works—until it doesn’t. Production environments expose weaknesses that AI simply can’t anticipate.\n3️⃣ Fixing one AI-generated bug often creates two more. Debugging AI-written code can feel like playing whack-a-mole.\n4️⃣ Ironically, deep coding knowledge is required to use AI effectively. The better you understand code, the better you can steer AI—and the less likely you are to fall into its traps.\n\nAI coding tools are powerful, but not magic. They accelerate development but don’t replace expertise. If you don’t know how to code well, AI won’t change that.",

That my work should speak for itself.\n\nBut if I’m being honest, it wasn’t just about the work. I was avoiding being seen.\n\nI was scared of being seen.\n\nMaybe you’ve felt this too.\n\n→ You want to put yourself out there, but you second-guess every post.\n\n→ You hesitate to share a photo or post a video because you don’t like how you look.\n\n→ You feel like you don’t have anything valuable to say, so you stay silent.\n\nI kept thinking, What if no one cares?\nWhat if I say the wrong thing?\nWhat if I just don’t belong in this space?\n\nSo, I stayed in the background. I helped others build their brands, create content, grow their visibility, while I remained invisible.\n\nThen one day, I realised:\n“How can I tell people to show up if I’m not doing it myself?”\n\nSo I posted. I shared my insights, my work, my thoughts, even when it felt uncomfortable.\n\nAnd you know what happened?\n\nNothing bad. No one called me out. No one asked me to stop.\n\nIn fact, people actually responded.\n\nNot because I had all the answers. Not because I was perfect. But because I showed up.\n\nSo if you’ve been waiting for the perfect moment, the perfect words, the perfect version of yourself: “stop waiting.”\n\nYou don’t need to be polished to be valuable.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to have something worth saying.\n\nYou don’t need permission to take up space.\n\nYou just need to “start”.\n\nBecause\nSomeone out there is waiting for your voice, your insights, your perspective.\n\nThey don’t need you to be perfect. They just need you to be you.\n\nThe world will never know what you have to offer unless you stop hiding.\n\nSo here’s your sign: Post the thing. Share your thoughts. Take up space.\n\nYou matter. You are enough. And the world needs to hear from you.\n\nWhat’s one fear that’s kept you from sharing your voice or showing up online?",

But over time, I found a system that keeps my content flowing—without overthinking.\n\nHere’s how I NEVER run out of ideas:\n\n1. Pay Attention to Conversations\n→ Every client call, DM, or comment is potential content.\n→ If someone asks a question, others are wondering the same.\n\n2. Share Lessons from My Own Journey\n→ Wins, struggles, mindset shifts—people relate to real experiences.\n→ Even small insights can spark meaningful discussions.\n\n3. Repurpose Old Content\n→ A post from 3 months ago? Rewrite it with a fresh angle.\n→ People forget, new connections haven’t seen it yet.\n\n4. Use the “What, Why, How” Framework\n→ What’s a common problem in my industry?\n→ Why does it matter?\n→ How can I solve it?\n→ Boom! That’s a post.\n\n5. Document, Don’t Just Create\n→ Behind the scenes of my business.\n→ What I’m working on.\n→ Challenges I’m tackling right now.\n\nContent isn’t about being creative every day—it’s about knowing where to look.\n\nWhich one do you use the most? Or struggling with? Drop a comment! ",

Here are some key techniques to help you get the most out of your SQL queries:\n\n 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗪𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀\n\nWildcard characters can be handy, but they can also slow down your queries. Use them sparingly and only when absolutely necessary to improve query speed.\n\n 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅𝗲𝘀\n\nIndexes are crucial for speeding up query performance. They help the database find and retrieve data faster.\n\n 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀\nChoosing the right data type for your columns is essential for optimizing performance. Use data types that best represent the data and ensure they are as specific as possible.\n\n 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀\n\nSubqueries can be resource-intensive and slow down your queries. Whenever possible, use joins instead of subqueries to improve performance.\n\n 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗟𝗜𝗠𝗜𝗧 𝗼𝗿 𝗧𝗢𝗣 𝘁𝗼 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗡𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗥𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱\n\nWhen you only need a subset of results, use the LIMIT (MySQL) or TOP (SQL Server) clause to limit the number of rows returned.\n\n 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗖𝗧\n\nUsing SELECT * retrieves all columns, which can be unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, specify only the columns you need to reduce the amount of data retrieved.\n 𝗘𝗫𝗜𝗦𝗧𝗦 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗜𝗡\n\nThe EXISTS clause is generally faster than the IN clause, especially when dealing with large datasets. Use EXISTS to check for the existence of a record in a subquery.\n\n 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗚𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗣 𝗕𝗬 𝘁𝗼 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮\n\nThe GROUP BY clause is useful for aggregating data and can help improve performance when used correctly.\n\n 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀\n\nStored procedures are precompiled and can execute faster than individual SQL queries. They also help with code reuse and maintainability.\n\n 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻\n\nA well-designed database schema can significantly improve performance. Normalize your database to eliminate redundancy and ensure that your tables are appropriately indexed.\n\n 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀\n\nTake advantage of query optimization tools provided by your database management system. These tools can help you identify performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements.\n\n 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲\n\nRegularly monitor the performance of your queries to identify and address any issues. Use performance monitoring tools to track query execution times and optimize as needed.",
