      "content": "Feel like your work in enablement isn‚Äôt getting the recognition it deserves? I get it.\n\nBecause I‚Äôve been there.\n\nAt the beginning of my enablement career, I thought I was doing everything right.\n\nI followed the advice that people kept shouting about:\n\n‚ÄúTrack activity metrics like calls and emails.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe product sells itself - just teach reps how to sell better.‚Äù\n‚ÄúFocus on onboarding - it‚Äôs what the business cares about.‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs the truth: that advice didn't work.\n\nWhy? Because it was completely out of touch with the challenges I actually faced in my job everyday:\n\n Conflicting demands from sales, leadership, and ops.\n Pressure to justify value in challenging economic climates.\n More savvy buyers and increased competition.\n Minimal guidance on how to tie enablement efforts to business outcomes.\n\nI wasted a lot of time following advice that wasn‚Äôt helping me move the needle.\n\nAnd here's what I had to learn the hard way, though. a lot of trial and error: Leadership doesn‚Äôt care how many training sessions you run...\n\nThey care about one thing: revenue.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not showing how your work ties back to revenue, your efforts will largely go unnoticed.\n\nI wish someone had told me that at the beginning of my enablement career.\n\nIt's also why so many enablers are stuck...\n\n Drowning in overhyped information that‚Äôs no longer relevant.\n Burning out doing tactical tasks that don't get them a promotion.\n Trying to piece together advice that doesn't actually solve the bigger challenges enablement faces in 2025.\n\nThe problem isn‚Äôt you - it‚Äôs the noise.\n\nWhat you need isn‚Äôt more generic advice that isn't relevant to the struggles you deal with on a daily basis.\n\nWhat you DO need is clarity, strategy and guidance that aligns with the world enablement is living and breathing in today.\n\nEnablement will only STOP being branded as the \"training and support function\" and START being recognised as a revenue-driving function, when we choose to step up and learn how to demonstrate revenue impact. If there is one skill you master in 2025, let it be THAT!\n\nP.S That‚Äôs exactly why I created the Strategic Enablement Blueprint. It‚Äôs the roadmap I wish I had when I started. A framework to cut through the noise and show you how to make an impact, get a promotion and remain relevant in today's competitive market. Join the waitlist here:",

But then the SI started delaying on deliverables.\n\nA little later they completely changed the solution, the team, and started asking for more money.\n\nChange request. Cha Ching!\n\nBy that time, we already paid per contract. So, the choice was to break up and sue them or pay.\n\nThe vendor was asking to pay for additional features, expended timeline and many more.\n\nThe client decided to extend the party.\n\nAs the result the project took 2 years instead of 1 year promised, and we went 100% over budget.\n\nNow let‚Äôs look at what happened here.\n\nThis system integrator used a playbook that many vendors love:\n1.     Bid low to win the deal. Pretend to be cost competitive.\n2.     Scope creep everything\n3.     Recover revenue that was lost at the beginning\n\nResult for the client?\n¬∑      Budget overrun\n¬∑      Timeline delay\n¬∑      Frustrated stakeholders\n\nHow can you avoid this trap?\n1.     Focus less on a cost but more on the right vendor\n2.     Have an experienced ERP consultant in your team who can see the low bidding\n3.     Hire an independent ERP advisor who can help you spot red flags and make the right decisions\n\nHey, but I have a rock-solid RFP process!\n\nRight. You will find out later.",
