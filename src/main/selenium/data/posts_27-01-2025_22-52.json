      "content": "Why ‚ÄúFake It Till You Make It‚Äù Is Not a Good Advice for Most of The Women Entrepreneurs\n\nCan we agree on one thing? ‚ÄúFake it till you make it‚Äù is exhausting advice.\n\nPretending to have it all figured out, acting like you know everything, and putting on a show, it‚Äôs not just draining, it‚Äôs also unnecessary for most of the women.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a woman entrepreneur, you already have enough on your plate without adding the pressure to fake confidence.\n\nAnd let me tell you something: pretending doesn‚Äôt build confidence, it builds burnout.\n\nHere‚Äôs what works instead:\n\n Own what you know.\n\nStart with your strengths. You don‚Äôt need to know everything, but what you do know? Use it.\n\n Be real about what you don‚Äôt.\n\nSaying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm learning‚Äù is so much more powerful than pretending. People connect with honesty, not perfection.\n\n Invest in yourself.\n\nRead, take courses, ask for help. Confidence grows with every new skill you learn, not with how well you fake it.\n\n Build your tribe.\n\nSurround yourself with people who lift you up and remind you of your worth on the tough days.\n\nWhen you stop pretending and start showing up as your real self, you attract the right clients, opportunities, and connections.\n\nSo here‚Äôs the truth: you don‚Äôt need to fake anything. You‚Äôre enough as you are. Every small step you take is what gets you closer to ‚Äúmaking it.‚Äù\n\nWhat‚Äôs your take? Let‚Äôs talk in the comments.",

Then ask yourself, how well is everyone comprehending the verbiage that was delivered?\n\nThere's a vast difference between communicating and comprehending. And yes, we focus on communication skills verses learning speaking skills to help us know our audience and adjust accordingly.\n\nIt's not easy to communicate for comprehension as it required us to think about the other person and their perspective (if you haven't read To Kill a Mockingbird Lately, now might be a good time). Yes, we must know what we'll say. We must also learn how to pressure test for comprehension, otherwise, we're simply having a bunch of words dump out of our mouth.\n\nTake a look at this article\n\nThen register for our upcoming Workout Wednesday where you'll get an overview of my Art of Conversation workshop. If you're looking to increase your conversational effectiveness, this 30 minute will change your life. (Link in the first comments.)",

Take ownership of your life and your choices. \n‚Ü≥ You are in the driver's seat, no one else can replace you.\n\n2. Show up every day, even when motivation fades. \n‚Ü≥ Success is found in the work you don't want to do.\n\n3. Commit to self-improvement with books, courses, etc. \n‚Ü≥ Winning at life means having a hunger to learn.\n\n4. Borrow from the brilliance of others. \n‚Ü≥ Avoid the pitfalls that others fell for by learning from them.\n\n5. Focus on speed; follow through on ideas quickly. \n‚Ü≥ Speed is everything and the key to success in your career.\n\n6. Enjoy the process. Success isn't a destination. Ô∏è\n‚Ü≥ Think about it: what's the point if you aren't having fun?\n\n7. Move in silence and stop announcing your goals. \n‚Ü≥ Go through periods of Monk Mode and focus on yourself.\n\n8. Outwork your self-doubt; action dispels anxiety. \n‚Ü≥ Imposter syndrome is natural; competence builds confidence.\n\n9. Play the long game because instant gratification is a trap. \n‚Ü≥ The average age of a millionaire is 61. It takes time to win.\n\n10. Consider your diet and the energy it feeds you. \n‚Ü≥ It can either energise you or drain you. It's your choice.\n\n11. Stack the small wins that build over time. \n‚Ü≥ That's how you stay motivated in the long term.\n\n12. Become so consistent that you are perceived as almost robotic. \n‚Ü≥ Relentless consistency and momentum will carry you.\n\nRemember this:\nYou can do it. You are capable!\n\nDon't let your own self-narrative ruin your journey.\n\nWhich step is your favourite?\nLet me know in the comments ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\nÔ∏è Repost this to support your network's journey.\nAnd followfor more!\n\nIf you enjoyed this content, you might like my newsletter, Step by Step:\n\n\n\nI have 30+ free learning resources for you.",
