If you want to connect more effectively, focus on aligning your body language, tone, and words to truly resonate.\n\n How aware are you of the nonverbal signals you‚Äôre sending?\n\nBrooke ",

I appreciate the call but I am not your ideal client. I am not a contractor.\"\n\nHim - \"Look I am not trying to get you to commit to anything today. What I'd like to do is set up some time to walk you through the platform and see if it fits your needs.\"\n\nMe - \"Let me ask. Do you even know what I do?\"\n\nHim - \"No I don't.\"\n\nWhat are the key takeaways here:\n- There was zero personalization. This is the issue with automation and playing the numbers game. When you just bang the phones and send a bunch of emails, you run the risk of hitting people that you really shouldn't be. They feel that.\n- Zero research. How do you call someone and not have some sense of what they do?!\n- Not listening. Just running through the script and what the books says the objection response should be. No credibility or 'human element' the call.\n\nWhat else happened here?\n\nThe bottom line is this - if you are going to reach out to someone, have a reason. Know who you are calling. They need to feel like this is an outreach just for them, not for them and everyone else. This isn't about being different, this is just about not being lazy and recognizing what you're actually doing! I'd rather make 10 calls to researched, compelling (for a reason), targets than make 100 cold calls from a list AI generated for me.\n\nP.S. I certainly appreciate the effort and honesty.",

Their parents can't bail them out and get them back on their feet, and whatever debt they may owe will likely follow them for life. Doing this over and over again can bring utter ruin rather than the success they were promised.\n\nIf you can't understand why someone isn't taking risks, ask yourself whether they can pay the cost of failure.

Managing brand deals, sponsorships, and newfound income isn't just a challenge‚Äîit's a crash course in financial education. \nHere are a few key takeaways from today‚Äôs reflections:\n\nÔ∏è Every Dollar Tells a Story: Whether it‚Äôs a massive NIL deal or a smaller partnership, understanding how money flows in and out is vital. Budgeting is no longer optional; it‚Äôs the foundation of long-term security.\nÔ∏è Taxes Aren‚Äôt a Surprise Party: The first paycheck might feel like winning the lottery, but ignoring Uncle Sam is a costly mistake. Preparing for taxes early is part of the game plan.\nÔ∏è Invest Early, Rest Easy: NIL income can be temporary, but the habits and investments we build now can pay dividends for decades. Compound interest is the real MVP.\nÔ∏è Learn to Say No: Not every deal aligns with your brand or long-term goals.\n\nFinancial literacy also means understanding the value of what not to pursue.\nThese lessons aren‚Äôt just for athletes‚Äîthey apply to anyone navigating new financial opportunities. The NIL era creates a generation of young people learning, adapting, and stepping up. It‚Äôs a reminder that the climb‚Äîwhether up Rocky‚Äôs steps or in life‚Äîtakes discipline and the right tools.\n\nWhat‚Äôs your take on the connection between opportunity and financial education? Drop your insights in the comments below‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear how you‚Äôre tackling the climb in your way!\n\nYou can listen to more of my thoughts HERE:",
