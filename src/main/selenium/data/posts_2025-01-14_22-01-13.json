      "content": "I walked into my termination meeting at my last job thinking I was getting a promotion.\n\nI remember sitting in a cafe that Friday for the 4:30 pm call, which started off like any other weekly check-in with my manager.\n\nUntil we were at 10 minutes left in the call.\n\n“That’s why we’ve decided we’re parting ways with you, effective immediately after this call.”\n\nThose words echoed in the silence as I was at a loss for words, a loss for any feeling at all.\n\nBecause my expectation that I was going to bring up my promotion during this call was so different from this reality.\n\nWhen I could finally muster up the ability to speak, I blubbered out something like “Thank you for the opportunity to work with you guys.”\n\nEven though what I really wanted to say was “Why? Why was I given no heads up at all?”\n\nWhat I really wanted to do was to fight for myself, but what society tells us to do is to end things with dignity and not burn any bridges.\n\nSo that’s what I did. I stayed silent, until now.\n\nI’ve stayed silent that I was actually so bitter and traumatized about how I was let go for many months afterward.\n\nIt wasn’t until recently that I’ve found closure by realizing it was precisely the difference between my own expectations vs reality that was the root of my pain:\n\nI falsely thought I was doing a great job and my role was safe because I was 1 out of 6 people in the company, but the truth was the complete opposite.\n\nFor most people dealing with job loss during this recession, it is not your fault nor could you have done anything to prevent it.\n\nBut if there is one grave mistake you can prevent, it’s being foolish enough to believe in the myth of job security.\n\nIf you found this post valuable, make sure you reshare and followfor more!",

Your ability to work hard through storms.\n2. Your ability to stay humble through glory.\n\nSaturn is a task master. Saturn is an examiner.\n\nIt's not been an easy year for me either. I have put my head down and worked through it all.\n\nSome times, while my head was down and working... my eyes teared up with the pressure of being an adult.\n\nSome times while my head was down and working... God gave me moments to smile & breathe.\n\nIt's been a year that's tested me to my last degree of resistance.\n\nIt's a year that's taught me : Faith and belief can overcome the false storms of what we call \"suffering\"\n\nMy knee injury was a gift as much as my national award was.\n\nMy poor mental health was a gift as much as public adulation was.\n\nLife's purpose is to grow. Often through the dungeons of suffering as much as through the dungeons of success.\n\nGet even healthier this year.\nMeditate deeply this year.\nPursue peace this year.\n\nBut whatever you do, believe that God is with you through every step.\n\nHappy 2025, have a blessed one!\n\n2025 - Year of \"Mars\"\n\nPour your intensity into the speed and strength of your work.\nNow overcome your own demons.\nNow grow more easily.",

I've studied the science of impossible goal setting and believe in my heart that every wild, impossible goal is hidden behind false assumptions of what we believe to be true.\n\nLast week, I gave my Impossible Possibilities workshop to members of The Upside; this question generated the most energy among nearly 70 members.\n\nWhat are the characteristics and qualities of the person who could achieve your impossible goal?\n\nWhen you match the process of believing in your impossibility with IDC (Intentional, Discipline, Consistency) you, your team and your organization can achieve the impossible.\n\nMusk, Bezos, and Oprah are no different than you or me - they imagined an impossible goal, built belief, and took massive action.\n\nThe Four Step Process:\n- Define your impossible goal – something that scares you but excites you even more\n- Question your basic assumptions about who you serve, how you operate, and what defines success\n- Identify the person you need to become to achieve this goal\n- Find the \"WHOs\" – the people who can help make your impossible possible\n- Commit to taking bold action, even when (especially when) failure feels likely\n\nAt, we go deep into the process to reverse engineer goal setting and success with teams and talent. Setting impossible goals is a process of unlocking awareness (around assumptions and the past) and allowing for inspired thinking for a better way forward. If you want to learn more about the process or want to host a team workshop to create the impossible goal, please shoot us a DM.\n\n[Thanks tofor attending the workshop and creating this image of the process!]",

My remit is significantly growing entering next year, despite only being here 7 months.\n\nMy work on Sales Introverts doesn't come at the expense of LaunchDarkly. It accentuates my impact.\n\nIf Sales Introverts got in the way of my work, I’d be told to “stop or you’ll be fired.”\n\nTrust me, CEOs and CROs don’t have any tolerance for poor performing senior sales leaders, especially if they think their performance suffers because of distractions.\n\n\n2) Your impact doesn’t have to be limited to your company\n\nHere is feedback received just in the last few days from sellers taking my programs:\n\n“Took the whole class Tuesday night and generated the two largest cold opps of my career in two days, one that might close this quarter due to the creating the PoV video”\n\n“Genuinely SO glad I opened that promo email. I’m pretty obsessed with the whole framework you’ve built, Kyle. Big fan over here. I just wish you were funnier…” (can’t do it all, I guess)\n\n“I took your framework to heart and ended up at 200% of goal in my first full Q.”\n\nI never would have talked to these sellers without my work on Sales Introverts, much less helped them progress their careers.\n\n\n3) Sellers should find leaders that want to develop them\n\nSome of my best AEs applied to work with me after first taking one of my programs. Seeing my approach to development has been my number one selling point as a sales leader.\n\nWithout my work on Sales Introverts, these AEs would have no idea who I am, and I wouldn’t be able to attract the caliber of talent I need to win.\n\nThere’s plenty of time in a week to put my all into my “real job” and progress Sales Introverts.\n\nIt’s meant giving up some other hobbies but it’s been well worth it.",
