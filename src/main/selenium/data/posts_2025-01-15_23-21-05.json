      "content": "Last year, I launched a private slack community for female founders and women in VC (+ active angels). Why? A Yale University study found that gender bias in venture capital is undisputed.\n\nFinding that investors who have experienced a poor outcome from a woman-led startup shy away from other women founders—but benefitting from successes of women founders doesn’t lead them to invest more.\n\nAll-women founding teams have never secured more than 3% of venture capital funding. The point of our community is to bring together female founders and funders and provide a space for knowledge-sharing, networking, and check-writing!\n\nI'm proud to report in 2024, we had our first pre-seed deal sourced and closed via the community. More on that soon \n\nI've seen the power of community, and know we can make progress by coming together.\n\nIf you're interested in joining, drop your email in the comments (or DM me), so I can share more information ",

Because when you’re not caught up in busywork, you have time to:\n️ Think of new ideas.\n️ Focus on strategy.\n️ Build a long-term vision.\n\nThis is why most businesses, like restaurants, struggle to scale. The owner is often behind the counter or in the kitchen, working in the business instead of on it. No one’s focusing on marketing, customer service, or the bigger picture.\n\nDelegation isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity for a business that wants to grow.\n\nI'm curious, what things have you delegated that have helped you scale your business?",
