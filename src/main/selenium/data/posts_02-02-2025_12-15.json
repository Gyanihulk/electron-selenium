Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical resources.\n-\n\n3. Use caching techniques (browser caching, server-side caching) to reduce server load.\n-\n\n4. Optimize database queries with proper indexing and efficient querying techniques.\n-\n\n5. Compress and optimize images to reduce file size without losing quality.\n-\n\n6. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.\n-\n\n7. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets from geographically distributed servers.\n-\n\n8. Minimize the use of blocking JavaScript and prioritize asynchronous operations.\n-\n\n9.

        "content": "Post number 21 in the series:\n\nExciting developments in the \nhashtag\n#recruitingNIL landscape, particularly in D1 men’s basketball. The proposed settlement agreement brings significant changes:\n\nStarting 2025, D1 men’s basketball teams will have a 15-player roster cap with the option to offer up to 15 scholarships. Notably, basketball will transition to an equivalency sport. This shift grants coaches the flexibility to allocate these scholarships, whether as full or partial awards, aligning with their unique recruiting strategies.\n\nKey points to note:\n- Opt-In Schools: These institutions will adhere to the 15-player roster limit and 15 scholarships while partaking in the revenue-sharing system. Schools must declare their intent to opt in by March 1 annually, commencing in 2025.\n- Opt-Out Schools: Programs opting out will maintain the current 13 scholarships model and can exceed the 15-player roster limit. However, by opting out, they forfeit participation in the revenue-sharing system, denying their athletes access to the yearly financial distribution.\n\nThe main implication seems to be for walk-on players. Being an \"opt-out\" program is not an option for the Power 5 schools. With 138 basketball programs (69 each for men's and women's), and a current average roster size of 15.7 this effectively means a loss of nearly 370 non-scholarship positions at Power 5 schools. Effectively, after this takes effect, there are will likely be no more walk-on positions at D1 Power 5 schools.\n\nOther conferences will also find themselves at a competitive disadvantage for their bench and recruiting efforts if they don't follow suit, so it's very likely most of the 700 men's and women's D1 programs will cut the walk-on positions in lieu of all scholarship rosters.\n\nWas anyone a walk-on at their school's program? Thoughts?\n\nAlso there is a non-equivalent GAIN of scholarship spots at these same schools. Let's discuss that in post #22.\n\nFor more details, check out the proposed changes at the link below:",

A decade later the K-wave has taken the way we eat, shops and have fun.\n\nGrowing up, I saw India embrace Chinese food, then Italian, even Japanese (still love my veg Sushi!).\n\nBut today, Korean is the new cool.\n\nI recently learned that over 1.5 crore Indians consume Korean products. And, this transcends sectors:\n\n1. The Entertainment Revolution\n\nMy dad (who never watched anything beyond news) is hooked to shows like Squid Game and All of Us Are Dead these days.\n\nNo surprise - K-drama craze that saw 370% viewership growth onduring COVID!\n\n2. The Business Impact\n\nWhen we invested in, I saw the potential combo of Korean culture Indianized. This has continued in K-Beauty brands seeing 50% growth on.\n\nIn entertainment, India has become the 6th highest consumer of K-pop globally.\n\nThe most interesting part for me is, Gen Zs across India are even speaking Korean!?!?\n\nIn Ahmedabad I even saw a Gen Z focussed non Korean brand casually use Korean words in their marketing.\n\n3. The Food Evolution\n\nNowadays, I see Indian street vendors experimenting with Kimchi Dosas, Korean BBQ with Indian spices, and Gochujang-spiced curries. \n\nJust like we created our own version of Chinese food, Korean cuisine is getting its Indian makeover.\n\nA quick commerce platform operator told me it’s 16% of noodle sales already!\n\nI saw this fusion in action yesterday in @Knorr's new Korean Ramen TVC.\n\nGulshan Grover as the masked frontman from Squid Game - brought together India's 'Bad Man' with Korea's biggest show!\n\nJust like in India, Korean culture celebrates joy through food, and brands like Knorr are bringing these cultures together beautifully.\n\nThe question isn't whether K-culture will stay. It's how we'll make it uniquely Indian. Because, in our country, Indianization works!\n\nWhich K-trends have you jumped on?",

Life is short. You deserve better.\n\nHere are a few telltale signs of a toxic boss.\n No boundaries, you must be available on nights, weekends, and vacation\n Make you feel guilty for taking vacation time or parental leave\n Take credit for your work and don’t think twice about it\n Micromanage you to death - control and trust issues\n Promoted to role with no experience and no clue how to manage people\n Will throw you under the bus to deflect blame and protect themselves\n Will dismiss your ideas and bring them up later as their own\n Will sabotage you, gaslight you, undermine you with leadership\n\nToxic bosses are the number one reason people leave their employer. If you work in a toxic environment, I say don’t just quit. If you do you are giving your employer what they want.\n\nConsider all your options and put together a plan to get out as soon as possible. Whether it is...\n\n taking a leave of absence\n getting a new job\n negotiating an exit\n quitting if left with no other choice\n\nWhat is most important is you take action and not stay stuck in a bad situation that is harming you.

LinkedIn DMs. Cold calls\n\nBut heres what the top performing sales teams are doing differently: They’re using video\n\nAnd the data proves it\n\n Video creation is up 88%\n GTM teams are making 241% more videos per month\n AI powered video tools have skyrocketed 12x\n\n(Source: Vidyard’s 2025 video in business report)\n\nBut heres the problem…\n\nMost reps still arent using it\n\nAnd the ones that are? They’re closing more deals\n\nWhy? Because video makes you real\n\n• It builds trust faster than text\n• It gets higher response rates than plain emails\n• It turns cold outreach into a warm connection\n\nI used to overthink video too\n\n “I don’t like being on camera”\n “What if I mess up?”\n “It feels awkward”\n\nBut then I realized something. My competitors were using it. And they were winning\n\nSo I stopped overthinking it\n\nI found a tool that made it stupidly simple () hit record and never looked back\n\nNow? My teams videos have a 70-80% watch rate and drive real pipeline\n\nVideo isnt a “nice to have” anymore. Its the cheat code\n\nAre you using video in your sales process yet? If not whats holding you back?\n\n𝗣.𝗦. Huge shoutout to&at Sendspark for constantly improving the game. Their latest UI updates make video creation easier than ever ",
