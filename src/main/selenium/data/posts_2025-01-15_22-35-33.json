      "content": "Anyone else feeling concerned right now? \n\nI have been reading about the recent decisions by companies likeandto scale back their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programmes.\n\nInclusion is something I view as vital not only in business, but in society.\n\nLooking ahead, surely this ‚Äúscaling back‚Äù has the potential to lead to multiple harmful outcomes:\n\nReduced workforce diversity - which in turn may limit the variety of perspectives and ideas which are essential for innovation and problem-solving.\n\nDamage to company reputation - especially amongst consumers and business partners who prioritise DEI and social responsibility (perhaps these businesses are so big that it doesn‚Äôt matter‚Ä¶)\n\n Decreased employee morale and engagement - particularly from underrepresented groups and their allies.\n\n Legal and compliance risks - in relation to equality, which may leave businesses exposed to claims of discrimination.\n\n Increased turnover rates - a costly and time-consuming issue to remedy.\n\n‚Äôs full article can be found here \n\n\n\nI know I‚Äôm not the only person who feels uneasy about all of this.\n\nTo quote, author of ‚ÄúUnwavering‚Äù and a prominent DEI advocate:\n\n\"Diversity is a fact, but inclusion is a choice we make every day. As leaders, we have to put out the message that we embrace, and not just tolerate, diversity.\"\n\nLike many others, I will watch this space with trepidation.\n\nIn the meantime,will continue to champion change, raise awareness and keep building an inclusive culture.\n\n\n\n[ Image is taken from an article in The Guardian from 10 January.

      "content": "Voices of Courage: Individuals Willing to Share Their Journeys\n\n\n\n\nRecently, I engaged with a member of the LinkedIn community who raised significant concerns regarding the current screening and interviewing methodologies employed by a percentage of today‚Äôs hiring managers.\n\nHe shared his experience, which initially seemed promising but devolved into a discouraging series of lengthy interviews followed by rejection due to an automated system. This scenario leads me to question whether this indicates a broader trend within the hiring landscape or merely an anomaly.\n\nI am curious how many Green Banners members have encountered similar challenges.\n\nThroughout my professional journey, I have navigated favorable and challenging interview situations (\n) with various organizations. At times, it has felt as though a preferred candidate was predetermined, a sentiment that became apparent after navigating a protracted interview process.\n\nThis recurring pattern leads me to wonder whether these experiences represent a widespread trend or are exceptions.\n\nI invite those who feel comfortable to contribute their experiences. I recognize that it may be daunting to speak out, but your willingness to share may contribute significantly to our understanding of this concern.",

Most companies have a 10% annual attrition rate. So, that's a minimum 15.6 million people looking for a new job...every single year. One company, Salesforce, receives 1 million applicants a year.
