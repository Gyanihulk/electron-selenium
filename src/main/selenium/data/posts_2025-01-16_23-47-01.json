      "content": "Witnessing your own generation become socially irrelevant on LinkedIn is surreal.\n\nA very rare few in my age group (45-55) are active on LinkedIn‚Ä¶technically they‚Äôre here, but their voices are muted.\n\n-They consume content, but they don‚Äôt post.\n-They comment, but only if prompted.\n-They have opinions, ideas, knowledge and above all experience (aka wisdom)‚Ä¶but they choose not to share.\n\nAnd with that my generation is quickly fading into obscurity as social platforms are adopted by younger generations open to sharing opinions / expertise / advice.\n\nCreating a massive generational void to navigate for the seasoned business vets who simply don‚Äôt want to participate.\n\nI hear from many in my age group complaining about losing market share, business and revenue because they are being out flanked by a younger generation leveraging LinkedIn and other social platforms.\n\nAnd in the same breath‚Ä¶turn around and make fun of the young professionals who are eating their lunch on LI because they simply ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get it‚Äù.\n\nDon‚Äôt get it = EGO\nDon‚Äôt get it = LAZY\nDon‚Äôt get it = COMPLACENT\nDon‚Äôt get it = GAME OVER\n\nIf I‚Äôm talking to you or someone you know‚Ä¶please do yourself a favor and take advantage of this FREE platform.\n\nI‚Äôll make it easy‚Ä¶here is a cheat sheet to get started in 5 weeks:\n\nWeek 1 - like 20 posts daily\nWeek 2- leave 20 comments daily\nWeek 3- repost content you enjoy\nWeek 4- add thoughts to your reposts\nWeek 5 and beyond- POST YOUR OWN CONTENT\n\nTIP- be yourself, be kind, teach others and laugh.\n\nIf there is someone you‚Äôd like to see more of on LinkedIn drop them in comments or DM me their info.\n\nI‚Äôll connect with them about my strategy for battling the ‚Äúcringe‚Äù‚Ä¶and how to build their reputation on LinkedIn.\n\nTheir knowledge is becoming increasingly more valuable for new entrepreneurs, business owners and yes, even the mighty influencers.\n\n__________________\nBonus Tip- invest in a solid image and hook to draw people into your post.",

From developing trademark strategies to analyzing patents and addressing copyright issues, the hands-on projects equipped me with practical skills to craft integrated IP strategies tailored to organizational goals.\nAs intellectual property continues to shape the future of technology, pharmaceuticals, and entertainment, I am excited to leverage this knowledge to contribute effectively in the legal and business domains.\nA big thank you to the instructors and peers who made this learning experience so enriching!",
