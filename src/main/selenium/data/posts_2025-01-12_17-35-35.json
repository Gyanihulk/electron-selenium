Torres sold fake jewellery and told people they would get amazing returns on their money - starting at 6% and going up to 13%.\n\nThe company mainly floated four schemes:\n• Invest in gold for a weekly interest of 2%,\n• Silver for interest of 3%,\n• Moissanite stones in silver for 4% interest\n• Investments only in Moissanite stones for an interest of 5-6%.\n\nThe scheme operators gradually increased the interest rate towards the end of the year to extract more money from the investors.\n\nTo make people believe they were legitimate, they even gave away fancy prizes like cars and expensive phones.\n\nThey asked people to invest in cash to get a weekly interest of 11.5% if invested in cash.\n\nDue to the bonus interest in cash investments, many people invested in cash and now worry if police will be able to recover their cash investment in the fraud amount.\n\nInitially people invested money and after getting timely returns they invested more and also encouraged their family members, relatives, friends etc.\n\nAnd if any investors bring new investors, then the person would get a 20% interest on investment for referral.\n\nThere are investors who were operating like agents, as they brought dozens of investors to the company, and were earning the referral bonus/interest.\n\nEventually they too lost all their money\n\nTo make investors trust them, the senior executives while conducting seminars would say that they get gold at a cheaper rate and they make a 300% profit on it. From this 300% profit they are able to give these unbelievable returns to the investors. This convinced investors and they made huge investments.\n\nJust before Christmas 2024, when they had collected money from about 125,000 people, Torres suddenly shut down all their stores and vanished.\n\nThe scammers also put up pictures and names of three random people on their website, trying to blame them for everything.\n\nThe scam came into light when a vegetable vendor Khar Pradipkumar Vaishya, 31 who along with his relatives lost Rs 4.5 crore to the fraud and complaint to the police.\n\nThe company also staged a fake robbery to buy more time to wind up everything and run away.\n\nPolice have arrested company's GM Taniya Xasatova alias Tazagul Karaxanovna Xasatova, director Sarvesh Ashok Surve, and store in-charge Valentina Ganesh Kumar.\n\n-\n\n 𝗣𝗢𝗗𝗖𝗔𝗦𝗧 - Feed your true crime obsession.
