By championing the school‚Äôs complete renovation, the foundation and it‚Äôs partners has transformed it into a vibrant space where today‚Äôs students can learn, imagine, and aspire without limits.\n\n A Circle of Gratitude\nThis journey came full circle when the leaders of the city and the school came together and honored our foundation with a Certificate of Appreciation, recognizing our collective impact on education and community. It‚Äôs a testament to what happens when vision meets collaboration.\n\nTo the children of Nepal: May this school be your launchpad. To my peers and partners: Thank you for turning a personal legacy into a shared mission. And to every child who walks these halls‚Äîdream boldly. The world is waiting for you. ",

Deal with Yourself\n- Do the work before asking others to.\n- Keep your word, even when no one is watching.\n- Stay humble. No one follows a leader who only serves themselves.\n\n4.

On my 30th birthday, I cried for days because I didn‚Äôt have my private jet. I made a promise to myself: By 40, I will have it.\n\nWell‚Ä¶ my birthday is next week, and I still don‚Äôt have a private jet. In fact, every dollar I make, I reinvest into.\n\nSo I had to ask myself‚Äîis money really the right metric for success?\n\nOr should we measure success by:\n\nHow many lives we‚Äôve changed?\n\nHow much joy we bring to people?\n\nHow many trees did we save on this planet?\n\nI decided to look back on the last 10 years. If I measure by money alone, I might feel like I‚Äôve failed. But if I measure by impact, here‚Äôs what I see:\n\n I‚Äôve built six companies‚Äîtwo of them are growing fast.\n\n I‚Äôve helped over 100 businesses worldwide, saving several from bankruptcy and preventing thousands of layoffs.\n\n I‚Äôve changed the lives of at least 1,000 people, bringing joy, inspiration, and opportunity.\n\n I created SWAY, an alternative to traditional management that has already impacted 34 industries.\n\n I‚Äôve trained and empowered over 100 business coaches, helping them find success and support businesses.\n\n I learned English from scratch, became a speaker in 21 countries, and moved to the USA with my son.\n\n I‚Äôve cleaned plastic from rivers, delivered fresh food to those in need, and contributed to making the world a better place.\n\nWhat if success isn‚Äôt about money‚Äîbut about kindness, joy, and the energy we share with people, animals, and nature?\n\nWhat if we measured success not by the dollars in our bank accounts but by the positive impact we create‚Äîdaily, weekly, or yearly?\n\nOn my 30th birthday, I cried because I didn‚Äôt have a private jet.\nOn my 40th, I will celebrate the impact I‚Äôve made on this planet.\n\nAnd I promise‚Äîto give even more in the next 10 years.\n\n How do you measure success?",

The glossy curves capture grainy black-and-white clips of legendary race cars speeding down the track. The reflections ripple across the car‚Äôs aerodynamic lines, distorting like memories replaying on a futuristic canvas. The dramatic lighting casts deep shadows, with rim lights subtly outlining the contours of the vehicle, adding to its aggressive presence. The atmosphere is cinematic and immersive, blending hyper-realistic automotive photography with nostalgic motorsport storytelling. There's a faint glow of static interference in the footage bridging past and future in a stunning visual composition, 35mm film.\n\nPROBLEM AREAS:\n+ Car isn‚Äôt consistent\n+ Color varies from shot-to-shot\n+ Texture varies from shot-to-shot\n\n(Fixable with more detailed prompts)\n\nQUICK THOUGHTS:\n+ This was a first shot attempt\n+ Only used one prompt for the full video\n+ Just kept hitting generate\n+ The coherence was impressive\n+ Wasn‚Äôt expecting to get a good result\n+ Tried this prompt with other vid-gen tools\n+ The results were close‚Ä¶but not like this\n+ Veo2 has a nice hold on realism\n+ But it also has a creative streak in it\n\nSometimes it‚Äôs helpful to push the tools.\nAnd see what you can get.\nSeeing more uses for this because of it.\n\nHave fun.",

It‚Äôs evolving to meet the moment.\n\nAccording to Harvard Business Review, 70% of leadership development comes from on-the-job experiences.\n\nWhich means the best leaders aren‚Äôt just born‚Äîthey‚Äôre built.\n\nUnderstanding leadership theories helps you refine your approach and lead with impact.\n\nStudy my 9 essential leadership theories every leader must know:\n\n1. Great Man Theory\n‚Ü≥ Leaders are born, not made. This outdated idea sparked leadership studies but ignores the power of growth and learning.\n\n2. Trait Theory\n‚Ü≥ Leadership is about personality traits‚Äîlike confidence, intelligence, and decisiveness. While useful for self-assessment, traits alone don‚Äôt make a great leader.\n\n3. Behavioral Theory\n‚Ü≥ Leaders are made, not born. This theory focuses on actions over traits, proving that leadership skills can be learned and developed.\n\n4. Transformational Leadership\n‚Ü≥ Inspires, mentors, and empowers. Transformational leaders create high-performing teams, but this style requires strong vision and adaptability.\n\n5. Transactional Leadership\n‚Ü≥ A system of rewards and consequences. Best for structured environments, but overuse can stifle creativity and engagement.\n\n6. Contingency Theory\n‚Ü≥ No single leadership style works in every situation. Success depends on aligning leadership style with the circumstances.\n\n7. Situational Leadership\n‚Ü≥ Flexibility is key. Leaders adjust their approach based on their team‚Äôs skill and motivation, shifting between hands-on coaching and hands-off delegation.\n\n8. Participative Leadership\n‚Ü≥ Decisions aren‚Äôt made in isolation. This democratic style fosters collaboration and innovation‚Äîused by companies like Microsoft to drive success.\n\n9. Adaptive Leadership ‚Äì Resilient-Change\n‚Ü≥ Leaders navigate uncertainty, embrace challenges, and drive innovation in evolving environments.\n\nWhat would you add to my list?\n\n Repost to inspire your network!\n\nFollow me Kevin Box Ô∏è for more stuff like this.\n\n I'm hosting a free 1.5-hour workshop on February 22nd at11:30 AM Central Standard Time on growing your personal brand and thought leadership on LinkedIn.\n\nEveryone who signs up and attends will receive my new 23-page guide, 12 Golden Nuggets to Building Your Online Business ‚Äì packed with insights on personal branding and earning on LinkedIn.\n\nClick here to register for the workshop:",

I've stopped calling my KT sessions \"knowledge transfer\", and have started to label them \"knowledge extraction\" in the outlook requests that I send to my stakeholders.\n\nThe agenda for these sessions is a clearly defined list of questions that need to be answered by the departing parties, and I need to make sure I do everything in my power to extract the knowledge I need before they depart.\n\nI'm a big fan of calling things what they are in place of overly formal politically correct language. I find that using more accurate language such as \"knowledge extraction\" sets the tone for what is in that meeting (even though it runs the risk of rubbing some stakeholders the wrong way).\n\nI tend to prioritize clarity over tact/diplomacy in most of my communications, but don't recommend that approach for everyone -- your language has to mesh with your style.",

While that would be great, thats not always the case and that is where having questions prepared come in handy and also confirming what they have understood and probing further on things that are not clear.

With key discussions on global collaboration, ethical AI, and economic investments, it was clear that AI is no longer just a tool it‚Äôs the driving force of the next industrial revolution.\n\nAs the owner of ZAiLUM (an AI solutions company) and All Advertising (a cutting-edge ad agency), I can‚Äôt help but reflect on how these developments impact not just our businesses, but also our clients, partners, and fellow entrepreneurs. AI is evolving rapidly, and the way we adapt, integrate, and innovate will define our success in the years ahead.\n\nWhat This Means for Businesses Like Yours\n\n For Small Businesses\nAI is levelling the playing field. The summit‚Äôs emphasis on open-source AI and accessibility means that startups and SMEs will have access to tools that were once exclusive to tech giants. Imagine AI-driven marketing, automation, and customer insights‚Äîwithout the massive price tag. However, with new regulations emerging, businesses must stay informed about ethical AI use and compliance.\n\n For Large Corporations\nWith ‚Ç¨109 billion invested in AI infrastructure (just in France!), the global race for AI dominance is accelerating. Large businesses have the opportunity to lead the charge in AI-driven innovation, from automating operations to developing AI-powered branding and customer experiences. The challenge? Navigating the ethical and regulatory landscape while ensuring AI enhances, rather than replaces, human creativity and decision-making.\n\nAt ZAiLUM, we‚Äôre excited about the summit‚Äôs focus on ethical AI, transparency, and responsible development. As AI becomes more integrated into business strategies, we‚Äôre committed to helping clients leverage AI solutions without compromising security, ethics, or human values.\n\nAdvertising is changing fast. The conversations around AI governance highlight the importance of AI-driven marketing that is both effective and responsible. At All Advertising, we‚Äôre focused on delivering AI-enhanced campaigns that prioritise transparency, data privacy, and audience trust.\n\nThe AI Action Summit reinforced one key message: AI is here to stay‚Äîbut how we use it is what truly matters. Whether you‚Äôre a startup founder, a marketing director, or a corporate leader, now is the time to explore how AI can work for you.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts‚Äîhow is AI impacting your business? Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going. Drop a comment or reach out!",

        "content": "Does your mind ever get stuck in a loop worrying about something?\n\nThat was me last week. For some reason, my mind was buzzing with doubtful thoughts.\n\nFirst, I was worrying about a new project. Then I spiraled into worries about my business, my future, and all the bad ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù‚Ä¶oh, it got dramatic in my head.\n\nDeep down, I knew these were just untrue negative thoughts. But my mind kept talking back: ‚Äúbut, Emma, what if they ARE true?‚Äù\n\nWhen I‚Äôm stuck in this kind of mental gridlock, I turn to a different kind of solution.\n\nI ask for a sign that everything is going to be OK.\n\nSpecifically, I asked for that sign to be a hummingbird.\n\n(You can still see the odd hummingbird in winter in Oregon, so my worrying mind hoped I would see one.)\n\nThat afternoon, I went to a new Trader Joe‚Äôs (a fun little US supermarket) with my daughters. We were at the checkout and my daughter shouted: ‚ÄúMama, LOOK! Hummingbirds!‚Äù\n\nShe pointed behind us at a massive wall mural of three hummingbirds ‚Äî and I laughed because the sign was so big and clear. And it reflected what I already knew in my heart: that everything was going to be OK.\n\nSo if you find yourself looping on something worrisome and scary, and you want to know that it‚Äôs going to be OK, ask for a specific sign.\n\nIt can be anything: a purple flower, a unicorn, even Elvis.\n\nAnd then give it a few days. Your sign might not come in the form you expect. Instead of seeing a rainbow, you might hear a song on the radio about a rainbow.\n\nBut when you get the sign, you‚Äôll know.\n\nI regularly ask for signs, and the more you do it, the more you trust them.\n\nHave you received a sign lately?",

The ability to slow down, reflect, and allow processes to unfold naturally is a sign of true leadership maturity. Rushing decisions may lead to short-term results, but cultivating patience fosters trust, psychological safety, and long-term resilience within teams.\n\nI believe that patience is not about passiveness, but rather about strategic intent. It enables leaders to listen more deeply, empower their teams, and make more thoughtful, sustainable decisions.\n\nThe most effective leaders know when to act swiftly and when to pause, giving space for ideas and people to develop.\n\nAppreciate the valuable insights on this often underestimated leadership skill,.",
