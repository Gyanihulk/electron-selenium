As a Board Director of The Agrawal Foundation, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to the vision that revitalized Shri 3 Chandra Secondary School in Kalaiya, Nepal—a place that once opened doors for my mother and her brothers, shaping the trajectory of our family’s story.\n\nGrowing up, I listened to stories of how this humble school gave them the courage to dream beyond their circumstances.\n\nTwo years ago, the foundation led by Dr. Bajrang Agrawal and Pawan Agrawal, embarked on a mission to honor that legacy. By championing the school’s complete renovation, the foundation and it’s partners has transformed it into a vibrant space where today’s students can learn, imagine, and aspire without limits.\n\n A Circle of Gratitude\nThis journey came full circle when the leaders of the city and the school came together and honored our foundation with a Certificate of Appreciation, recognizing our collective impact on education and community. It’s a testament to what happens when vision meets collaboration.\n\nTo the children of Nepal: May this school be your launchpad. To my peers and partners: Thank you for turning a personal legacy into a shared mission. And to every child who walks these halls—dream boldly. The world is waiting for you. ",

Deal with your Team\n- Listen more than you talk.\n- Give credit, take the blame.\n- Lift people up, don’t push them down.\n\n2. Deal with your Vision\n- Stand for something, not just anything.\n- Make hard choices, not easy excuses.\n- Stay focused when things get messy.\n\n3. Deal with Yourself\n- Do the work before asking others to.\n- Keep your word, even when no one is watching.\n- Stay humble. No one follows a leader who only serves themselves.\n\n4. Deal with the Future\n- Think beyond today, build something that lasts.\n- Invest in people, not just results.\n- Lead in a way that inspires others to lead too.\n\nPeople don’t rise to the standard you demand.\nThey rise to the standard you set.\n\nLearn to share.\nShare to lead by example.\nLead by example to multiply impact.\n\nThat's the deal.\nIf you break the deal, people stop following.\nIf you honor it, they’ll go all in with you.\n\n---\n\nP.S. – This image is copyrighted.

        "content": "𝟐𝟎 𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫, 𝐈 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐈 𝐖𝐚𝐬 𝐖𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠.\n\nFor most of my life, I measured success by how much money I made. On my 30th birthday, I cried for days because I didn’t have my private jet. I made a promise to myself: By 40, I will have it.\n\nWell… my birthday is next week, and I still don’t have a private jet. In fact, every dollar I make, I reinvest into.\n\nSo I had to ask myself—is money really the right metric for success?\n\nOr should we measure success by:\n\nHow many lives we’ve changed?\n\nHow much joy we bring to people?\n\nHow many trees did we save on this planet?\n\nI decided to look back on the last 10 years. If I measure by money alone, I might feel like I’ve failed. But if I measure by impact, here’s what I see:\n\n I’ve built six companies—two of them are growing fast.\n\n I’ve helped over 100 businesses worldwide, saving several from bankruptcy and preventing thousands of layoffs.\n\n I’ve changed the lives of at least 1,000 people, bringing joy, inspiration, and opportunity.\n\n I created SWAY, an alternative to traditional management that has already impacted 34 industries.\n\n I’ve trained and empowered over 100 business coaches, helping them find success and support businesses.\n\n I learned English from scratch, became a speaker in 21 countries, and moved to the USA with my son.\n\n I’ve cleaned plastic from rivers, delivered fresh food to those in need, and contributed to making the world a better place.\n\nWhat if success isn’t about money—but about kindness, joy, and the energy we share with people, animals, and nature?\n\nWhat if we measured success not by the dollars in our bank accounts but by the positive impact we create—daily, weekly, or yearly?\n\nOn my 30th birthday, I cried because I didn’t have a private jet.\nOn my 40th, I will celebrate the impact I’ve made on this planet.\n\nAnd I promise—to give even more in the next 10 years.\n\n How do you measure success?",

The glossy curves capture grainy black-and-white clips of legendary race cars speeding down the track. The reflections ripple across the car’s aerodynamic lines, distorting like memories replaying on a futuristic canvas. The dramatic lighting casts deep shadows, with rim lights subtly outlining the contours of the vehicle, adding to its aggressive presence. The atmosphere is cinematic and immersive, blending hyper-realistic automotive photography with nostalgic motorsport storytelling. There's a faint glow of static interference in the footage bridging past and future in a stunning visual composition, 35mm film.\n\nPROBLEM AREAS:\n+ Car isn’t consistent\n+ Color varies from shot-to-shot\n+ Texture varies from shot-to-shot\n\n(Fixable with more detailed prompts)\n\nQUICK THOUGHTS:\n+ This was a first shot attempt\n+ Only used one prompt for the full video\n+ Just kept hitting generate\n+ The coherence was impressive\n+ Wasn’t expecting to get a good result\n+ Tried this prompt with other vid-gen tools\n+ The results were close…but not like this\n+ Veo2 has a nice hold on realism\n+ But it also has a creative streak in it\n\nSometimes it’s helpful to push the tools.\nAnd see what you can get.\nSeeing more uses for this because of it.\n\nHave fun.",

        "content": "Great leaders adapt to change. Poor leaders resist change.\n\n\nBecause leadership isn’t about fitting a mold. It’s evolving to meet the moment.\n\nAccording to Harvard Business Review, 70% of leadership development comes from on-the-job experiences.\n\nWhich means the best leaders aren’t just born—they’re built.\n\nUnderstanding leadership theories helps you refine your approach and lead with impact.\n\nStudy my 9 essential leadership theories every leader must know:\n\n1. Great Man Theory\n↳ Leaders are born, not made. This outdated idea sparked leadership studies but ignores the power of growth and learning.\n\n2. Trait Theory\n↳ Leadership is about personality traits—like confidence, intelligence, and decisiveness. While useful for self-assessment, traits alone don’t make a great leader.\n\n3. Behavioral Theory\n↳ Leaders are made, not born. This theory focuses on actions over traits, proving that leadership skills can be learned and developed.\n\n4. Transformational Leadership\n↳ Inspires, mentors, and empowers. Transformational leaders create high-performing teams, but this style requires strong vision and adaptability.\n\n5. Transactional Leadership\n↳ A system of rewards and consequences. Best for structured environments, but overuse can stifle creativity and engagement.\n\n6. Contingency Theory\n↳ No single leadership style works in every situation. Success depends on aligning leadership style with the circumstances.\n\n7. Situational Leadership\n↳ Flexibility is key. Leaders adjust their approach based on their team’s skill and motivation, shifting between hands-on coaching and hands-off delegation.\n\n8. Participative Leadership\n↳ Decisions aren’t made in isolation. This democratic style fosters collaboration and innovation—used by companies like Microsoft to drive success.\n\n9. Adaptive Leadership – Resilient-Change\n↳ Leaders navigate uncertainty, embrace challenges, and drive innovation in evolving environments.\n\nWhat would you add to my list?\n\n Repost to inspire your network!\n\nFollow me Kevin Box ️ for more stuff like this.\n\n I'm hosting a free 1.5-hour workshop on February 22nd at11:30 AM Central Standard Time on growing your personal brand and thought leadership on LinkedIn.\n\nEveryone who signs up and attends will receive my new 23-page guide, 12 Golden Nuggets to Building Your Online Business – packed with insights on personal branding and earning on LinkedIn.\n\nClick here to register for the workshop:",

I've stopped calling my KT sessions \"knowledge transfer\", and have started to label them \"knowledge extraction\" in the outlook requests that I send to my stakeholders.\n\nThe agenda for these sessions is a clearly defined list of questions that need to be answered by the departing parties, and I need to make sure I do everything in my power to extract the knowledge I need before they depart.\n\nI'm a big fan of calling things what they are in place of overly formal politically correct language. I find that using more accurate language such as \"knowledge extraction\" sets the tone for what is in that meeting (even though it runs the risk of rubbing some stakeholders the wrong way).\n\nI tend to prioritize clarity over tact/diplomacy in most of my communications, but don't recommend that approach for everyone -- your language has to mesh with your style.",

I always say the person that needs tgr information needs to put ib the work too and not just ahow up and expect the “transferer” to have everything well laid out with a pretty bow on it. While that would be great, thats not always the case and that is where having questions prepared come in handy and also confirming what they have understood and probing further on things that are not clear. I will adopt knowledge extraction instead of using the term KT. Thanks for sharing.",

Now. Even small steps add up.\n\nHere’s how to make it easy:\n\n Automate your savings so it happens without thinking.\n Use tax-advantaged accounts when possible.\n If your income fluctuates, set a baseline savings amount. Then, when you have a great month, save a percentage of the extra.\n\nWarren Buffett puts it best:\n\n “Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.”\n\nThe amount matters less than the habit.

Not every channel or every layer within a channel will work for every ICP (obviously), but you only know if you try new strategies.\n\nIn 2025, outbound sales success depends on breaking out of the mold.\n\n\n What is your # 1 cold calling tip?",

        "content": "This past week, the AI Action Summit took centre stage in Paris, bringing together world leaders, industry pioneers, and tech visionaries to shape the future of artificial intelligence. With key discussions on global collaboration, ethical AI, and economic investments, it was clear that AI is no longer just a tool it’s the driving force of the next industrial revolution.\n\nAs the owner of ZAiLUM (an AI solutions company) and All Advertising (a cutting-edge ad agency), I can’t help but reflect on how these developments impact not just our businesses, but also our clients, partners, and fellow entrepreneurs. AI is evolving rapidly, and the way we adapt, integrate, and innovate will define our success in the years ahead.\n\nWhat This Means for Businesses Like Yours\n\n For Small Businesses\nAI is levelling the playing field. The summit’s emphasis on open-source AI and accessibility means that startups and SMEs will have access to tools that were once exclusive to tech giants. Imagine AI-driven marketing, automation, and customer insights—without the massive price tag. However, with new regulations emerging, businesses must stay informed about ethical AI use and compliance.\n\n For Large Corporations\nWith €109 billion invested in AI infrastructure (just in France!), the global race for AI dominance is accelerating. Large businesses have the opportunity to lead the charge in AI-driven innovation, from automating operations to developing AI-powered branding and customer experiences. The challenge? Navigating the ethical and regulatory landscape while ensuring AI enhances, rather than replaces, human creativity and decision-making.\n\nAt ZAiLUM, we’re excited about the summit’s focus on ethical AI, transparency, and responsible development. As AI becomes more integrated into business strategies, we’re committed to helping clients leverage AI solutions without compromising security, ethics, or human values.\n\nAdvertising is changing fast. The conversations around AI governance highlight the importance of AI-driven marketing that is both effective and responsible. At All Advertising, we’re focused on delivering AI-enhanced campaigns that prioritise transparency, data privacy, and audience trust.\n\nThe AI Action Summit reinforced one key message: AI is here to stay—but how we use it is what truly matters. Whether you’re a startup founder, a marketing director, or a corporate leader, now is the time to explore how AI can work for you.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts—how is AI impacting your business? Let’s keep the conversation going. Drop a comment or reach out!",

        "content": "Does your mind ever get stuck in a loop worrying about something?\n\nThat was me last week. For some reason, my mind was buzzing with doubtful thoughts.\n\nFirst, I was worrying about a new project. Then I spiraled into worries about my business, my future, and all the bad “what ifs”…oh, it got dramatic in my head.\n\nDeep down, I knew these were just untrue negative thoughts. But my mind kept talking back: “but, Emma, what if they ARE true?”\n\nWhen I’m stuck in this kind of mental gridlock, I turn to a different kind of solution.\n\nI ask for a sign that everything is going to be OK.\n\nSpecifically, I asked for that sign to be a hummingbird.\n\n(You can still see the odd hummingbird in winter in Oregon, so my worrying mind hoped I would see one.)\n\nThat afternoon, I went to a new Trader Joe’s (a fun little US supermarket) with my daughters. We were at the checkout and my daughter shouted: “Mama, LOOK! Hummingbirds!”\n\nShe pointed behind us at a massive wall mural of three hummingbirds — and I laughed because the sign was so big and clear. And it reflected what I already knew in my heart: that everything was going to be OK.\n\nSo if you find yourself looping on something worrisome and scary, and you want to know that it’s going to be OK, ask for a specific sign.\n\nIt can be anything: a purple flower, a unicorn, even Elvis.\n\nAnd then give it a few days. Your sign might not come in the form you expect. Instead of seeing a rainbow, you might hear a song on the radio about a rainbow.\n\nBut when you get the sign, you’ll know.\n\nI regularly ask for signs, and the more you do it, the more you trust them.\n\nHave you received a sign lately?",

No second-guessing. No politics. Just real, open dialogue. That’s the power of trust. Without trust, teams fall apart. With it? They do their best work.\n\n“Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication.” – Stephen Covey\n\nLet’s be real—without trust, no amount of strategy will save your team. So how do you actually build it?\n\n Lead with transparency – Be open about challenges and decisions. People trust what they understand.\n Follow through on commitments – Reliability fosters credibility.\n Encourage psychological safety – When people feel safe to share ideas, innovation flourishes.\n\nIn my work with leaders, I’ve seen firsthand how trust transforms teams from merely functioning to truly excelling. It’s not just a “nice-to-have”—it’s the foundation for productivity, engagement, and collaboration.\n\n What’s one thing you do to build trust in your team? Drop your thoughts below! ⬇️",

If money wasn’t an issue and you could do any job, what would it be?\n→ Reveals passion, natural drive, and what fuels their energy.\n\n2. What was the last book, TV show, or film you really enjoyed?\n→ Shows how they think, what they value, and how they unwind.\n\n3. When was the last time you felt proud at work, and why?\n→ Uncovers what success means to them—impact, recognition, or financial gain.\n\n4. What would you do if you knew you were going to miss a work deadline?\n→ Tests accountability, problem-solving, and honesty under pressure.\n\n5. What do you think you owe an employer, and what do they owe you?\n→ Exposes their work ethic, expectations, and loyalty potential.\n\n6. What’s your ideal work environment?\n→ Helps assess if they’ll thrive in your company culture.\n\n7. How do you like to receive praise?\n→ Identifies their feedback preferences—regular validation or quiet acknowledgment.\n\n8. What are your top three strengths—and three weaknesses you’re actively working on?\n→ Reveals humility, self-improvement, and a growth mindset.\n\n9. What’s something you strongly believe in that most people disagree with?\n→ Shows independent thinking, conviction, and confidence in their values.\n\n10. If you had to teach someone something complex in 5 minutes, how would you do it?\n→ Assesses communication skills, clarity of thought, and patience.\n\n11. If you could change one decision from your past, what would it be and why?\n→ Tests honesty, self-reflection, and whether they learn from their mistakes.\n\n12. What do you do when you completely disagree with your manager?\n→ Reveals conflict resolution skills, emotional intelligence, and maturity.\n\n13. How do you handle working with someone you don’t like?\n→ Assesses professionalism, collaboration, and ability to separate emotions from work.\n\n14. If you had to make a difficult decision that would disappoint some people, how would you handle it?\n→ Tests ethical reasoning, leadership skills, and emotional intelligence.\n\n Hiring managers: Use these in your next interview.\n Candidates: Be ready for these.\n Save this for later - great hires start with great questions.\n\nRepost to help others make better hiring decisions and follow mefor more content like this.",

It enables leaders to listen more deeply, empower their teams, and make more thoughtful, sustainable decisions.\n\nThe most effective leaders know when to act swiftly and when to pause, giving space for ideas and people to develop.\n\nAppreciate the valuable insights on this often underestimated leadership skill,.",

You will get to the top. The right people will see you at the right time and all you've prayed for will be there staring you in the eyes.\n\nBut right now, are you ready to put in the work? Do you still believe in yourself? Have you written down your goals?\n\nThink about why you started and what will happen if you quit now. Keep moving. You've got this!\n\nI remain your Shining Pen, Oladayo Temitope.\n\nRemember, te adoro ️\n\nWriter | Speaker | Coach",
