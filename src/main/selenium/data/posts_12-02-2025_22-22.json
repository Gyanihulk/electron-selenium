An internationally recognized, multi-award-winning coach and social enterprise founder, Nicole doesn’t just identify gaps—she creates breakthroughs. With 13 coaching awards and a track record of working with Fortune Global 10-500 leaders, she’s transformed teams across industries, from biotech to finance. She’s led game-changing initiatives, including a $75K charity campaign and a call-in movement that helped restart provincial negotiations.\n\nNicole also walked us through the five rhetorical appeals—logos, ethos, pathos, kairos, and telos—showing us how to leverage them to engage with the media effectively. Her ability to connect, persuade, and drive action is what makes her a force in leadership, coaching, and social impact. \"You gave us what we wanted—and what we didn’t know we needed.\"\n\nThanks for your time today Nicole!",

        "content": "Up until this point, we’ve only just scratched the surface of what’s possible with AI. Glean’s vision is to empower everyday users and developers to create AI agents to automate personal tasks and business processes at scale.\n\nOver the past year,has performed 50+ million agent actions in enterprises. Notable examples include's career growth analysis agent,'s personalized sales outreach app, and's askT concierge for employee IT and HR needs.\n\nToday, we’re proud to be taking Glean one step further into the agentic era with the launch of Glean Agents—our horizontal agent environment for building, deploying, orchestrating, and governing AI agents across the enterprise.\n\nWith Glean Agents, companies can manage and govern thousands of agents, helping employees embrace AI in a compliant, safe way at scale.\n\nIt offers a user-friendly, natural language interface for building agents, connected to the broadest access to work data and world knowledge and a comprehensive slate of orchestrated actions.\n\nWe’re also introducing new platform capabilities integrated into Glean Agents:\n Universal knowledge: At work, we often switch between using internal and external data. Users can combine enterprise data with internet data, enabling the integration of online information, such as real-time industry insights, directly into Glean queries. Glean now provides the broadest and most comprehensive set of knowledge for work AI.\n\n Structured data analysis: When it comes to leveraging all the data in the enterprise, structured data is a piece of the puzzle that most AI solutions have yet to crack. Now, Glean’s universal knowledge capabilities are compatible with both structured and unstructured data, enabling users to bring data to every decision using natural language queries from a first set of structured data applications -,, and Jira.\n\nActive data and AI governance: AI is most useful when broadly-connected to corporate data, and we’ve offered comprehensive support for permissions from day one to protect enterprise data. We’re now introducing a new layer of governance that continuously protects against accidentally overshared data in the enterprise.\n\nPutting AI in the hands of every employee is the most pragmatic way to drive AI transformation.\n\nAI agents enable each employee to not only redefine their own productivity, but to build new AI-powered business processes that deliver top-line results for the organization: increased revenue, higher CSAT, and faster engineering time-to-market for new capabilities.\n\nRead more on these updates on our blog:and be sure to tune into Glean Live at 10am PT to get the first look at Glean Agents.

        "content": "Using intent signals to trigger your sales outreach? I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but…\n\nYou're late!\n\n90% of buyers choose a vendor that was on their short list at the beginning of the sales process\n\nIf you're not in at the beginning, you're very unlikely to win.\n\nA study by Harvard Business Review found that around 90% of the time B2B buyers go with their day-one list.\n\nThat means a narrow window of opportunity for your sales team. If you’re not on the buyer’s list from the get-go, your chances of winning the deal evaporate dramatically.\n\nConsider this...\n\n PEOPLE TRUST WHAT THEY KNOW\nIf buyers haven’t heard of you, they’re not even considering you, my friend. Familiarity builds trust. If you’re not showing up in search results (regular and AI-assisted), industry discussions and analyst reports, you’re The Invisible Vendor.\n\n EDUCATION BEATS PERSUASION\nBuyers don’t want to be sold to. They want a trusted guide. The vendors shaping the conversation before the buying process starts are the ones making the shortlist. If you’re waiting for them to raise their hand, you’re most likely too late.\n\n DECISIONS ARE MADE BY COMMITTEES, NOT INDIVIDUALS\nAn average of 13+ stakeholders weigh in on tech purchases. If someone in finance, IT, or operations prefers a familiar vendor, that vendor gets a head start. You need to influence the whole team — before the RFP even drops.\n\n PAST EXPERIENCE TRUMPS THE PERFECT PRODUCT\nBuyers stick with what they know. If someone on the committee has worked with a vendor before, that vendor has a major advantage. If you’re the new player, you need to earn trust early — long before they start shopping.\n\n SO, HOW DO YOU BREAK IN?\nBe seen BEFORE buyers start looking. Build brand awareness early.\nShare insights that shape how buyers think about their challenges.\nEngage with all stakeholders — not just decision-makers.\n\nMake sure your expertise is everywhere it can be — search, industry conversations, AI-driven research.\n\nIf you’re waiting for a buyer to show intent, you’re already too late. The real work happens long before they’re ready to buy.\n\nWhere are you showing up?\n\nYou’ve just read the first of 8 posts on influencing the B2B buying decision. Follow",

        "content": "great UX ~ great docs ~ great support.\n\nCompanies that nail all of the above tend to follow the same mindset.\n\nThat is: treat them all as \"interfaces\" - ways in which users use your product. API design falls in this bucket too.\n\nWhen thought about this way, the same design principles apply:\n\n1. Be self-explanatory\nEven users unfamiliar with your product should be able to quickly grasp how to accomplish a task or use a feature. Use plain, scenario-driven language. It should be \"obvious\" what a button, feature, or interface does without being a product expert. Good example here: in SaaS UIs, I tend to prefer labeled buttons instead of icon-only buttons. They take guesswork out.\n\n2. Be consistent\nRepetition helps build intuition. For UIs, using a consistent design language and UI components builds cues on how things should function. Similar idea applies to docs and even marketing: terminology and messaging should be the same across any user touchpoint.\n\n3. Think ahead\nOften, a feature team will ship with a narrow scenario in mind driven by a specific customer ask or deliverable. While it's important to ship fast, it's also good to do a thought experiment on how other customers may want to accomplish similar or related scenarios in the future. This doesn't mean over-build, but doing this \"look-ahead\" process does often reveal more generalizable and cleaner design choices and abstractions that don't lock you into a corner.\n\nReally great product-led teams cultivate a culture that thinks about all \"Interfaces\" with a similar level of consideration and craft.",

        "content": "Headcount Approval Process = Overlooked and Underdeveloped\n\n\nHere’s what usually happens:\n\n Approval bottlenecks: Too many sign-off steps slow everything down.\n Inconsistent data: Missing or inaccurate info leads to poor decisions.\n Manual processes: Spreadsheets and emails are mistakes waiting to happen.\n Bad communication: Requests get lost in the shuffle, and updates are hard to track.\n No forecasting: A nonexistent long-term view makes hiring feel reactive, not strategic.\n Budget blind spots: Budget constraint confusion leads to delays or overspending.\n\nThe result?\n\nHiring delays. Missed opportunities. Teams stuck understaffed.\n\nOr worse, overspending on roles that weren’t fully justified.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n Step 1: Align Before You Request\nThe Hiring Manager gets on the same page with the Head of Department about the new role. Then the HM submits the Headcount Request Form and explains in detail how this hire would impact company OKRs (annual planning or an ad-hoc request).\n\n Step 2: Benchmark the Role\nTalent Acquisition tags HR Ops to run salary benchmarking based on the role’s requirements for budget alignment before things move forward.\n\n Step 3: Get Budget Approval\nOnce the salary data is in, the TA loops the HoD back in to approve the request—including budget considerations. No budget surprises down the line.\n\n Step 4: The Hiring Committee Review\nAfter HoD approval, TA sends the request to the Hiring Committee. They review, approve, or reject the request. If rejected, detailed feedback goes back to the HM and HoD to keep things transparent.\n\n∎ Pro Tip: If the committee thinks the request lacks justification, they’ll tag the HoD for more context. Still not enough? The request gets formally rejected—no gray areas.\n\nEasy. At least, it should be.\n\nThe biggest problem I see is 'Who's in charge of actually setting up the steps?'\n\nSo here's my question:\n\nWhat's really slowing down your headcount approval process? Is it lacking one or all of the steps? Or waiting on an unknown person to set up the steps in the first place?",
