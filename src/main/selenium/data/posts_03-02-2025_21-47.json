You think you're asking the right questions.\n\nBut somehow, the response feels… off.\n\n️Maybe the AI is stuck in a loop.\n️Or maybe it misunderstood your intent entirely.\n\nHere’s a simple solution: Ask it to review and summarize the instructions you’ve given it.\n\nYou might think you’ve provided crystal-clear guidance, but have you? Or did the AI interpret it differently?\n\nTry this approach:\n\n→Ask the AI to summarize your instructions.\n→Have it evaluate how well it’s following them.\n→Adjust your communication style based on its response.\n\nWe often forget that LLMs are language models. The way we communicate with them defines their output.\n\nA small tweak in phrasing can be the difference between a helpful response and a frustrating one.\n\nNext time AI isn’t acting as expected, don’t assume it’s broken, assume it needs clearer guidance.\n\nStruggling with AI adoption in your business?

People were dying, and hospitals were overcrowded with patients.\n\nThe situation became so grim that family members couldn’t even cremate the dead bodies of their loved ones.\n\nThat’s when my parents decided to act — someone had to do something. What started as helping our neighbours, grew into hundreds and thousands.\n\nThey decided to step out from their homes and distribute masks, sanitizers and food to everyone for free of cost.\n\nEventually my father was being recognised as the “Langer waale Sardar Ji” (translation: the Sardar who distributes free food). His turban became a symbol of hope and change.\n\nIt became a part of our routine to distribute free food every Sunday. We continued this even after the pandemic ended.\n\nIn 2023, we decided that our efforts need more recognition so that the impact can be 100x.\n\nThat’s when the name, Sachi Seva was christened.\n\nEverything was going good but we weren’t satisfied. We realised that we can’t handle everything- from social media to helping people on ground level. We need more help.\n\nFinally in 2025, we have decided to hire people. We are looking for video editors and content strategists, who can handle the Instagram account of our collective.\n\nCheck the comment box for detailed description on the roles.\n\nMy parents have passed the baton of leadership to me and I want to do justice to their work. Come and join me as we create ripple effects of change.\n\nAlso, it is a UN recognised project now so brownie points for that",

I doubt they are the only company experiencing this.\n\nIt’s another story for product that’s ordered consistently, where prices can fluctuate and suppliers can simply raise prices. Doesn’t mean that price will stick, unless there are limited alternatives. Think\n. Mexico represents 40+% of the international market. Here are some other categories:\n\nWhat are you all seeing out there? This is about to get very interesting, even if the tariffs don’t end up being imposed for long.",

Based on my calculations—factoring in ex-factory cost, load (tariff and transportation), wholesale margin, and retailer margin—a shoe that was previously selling for around $90 at retail will now likely be priced at $115 or more.\n\nWe can do similar illustations on higher priced footwear, for Canada.\n\nBeyond the immediate price increase, both wholesalers and retailers may consider taking a higher margin as a precautionary measure. The concern is that this initial 25% tariff could escalate further due to the ongoing political and diplomatic strategies that may lead to tit-for-tat tariff adjustments. in those tariffs. If that happens, businesses may need to adjust margins further to maintain profitability and manage uncertainty. Unfortunately, some consumer sales will decline if prices become too high.",

Take time to meet people, build rapport and don’t rush the process: it pays off \n\n- Breakfast meetings = better results\nEarly morning, informal breakfast meetings often lead to more productive conversations\n\n- Patience is KEY\nMexican business culture is a mix of flexibility and formality: be patient with timing, and respect local customs ️\n\n- Hierarchy matters\nIn Mexico, seniority matters: in meetings make sure you bring the right people to the table\n\n- Stay accessible via WhatsApp\nEmails are great but WhatsApp is where the real action happens: be ready to respond quickly \n\n- Dress smart & adapt to the heat\nAlways look professional but remember the weather: it’s not all about suits when it’s 30°C!\n\n\nWith the economy booming and Mexico emerging as a key global player, understanding the local culture and adapting your approach is critical for success!\n\n\nAre you considering expanding into Mexico or are you already doing business here? \n\n———",

It’s helping people escape repetitive processes and focus on maximizing their creative potential. What’s better than more humans creating more creative content, with less effort?\n\nWe’re entering an era where technology amplifies imagination and innovation, making it easier than ever for people to bring their ideas to life.

I believe this makes up 90% of personal development.\n\nWe, as humans, are deeply emotional creatures. Our emotions evolved for survival, triggering responses that once kept us safe in the wild. But today, those same emotions often hold us back, not from predators, but from opportunities, challenges, and growth.\n\nA study published in Psychology Today reveals that one of the biggest reasons people avoid taking risks is the fear of uncertainty, even when those risks could lead to personal development. (Find link below)\n\nThink about that for a second. How many times have you hesitated, not because you weren’t capable, but because you feared the unknown?\nEmotional regulation isn’t about suppressing emotions. It’s about developing the awareness to respond intentionally, rather than reacting impulsively.\n\nLink to the Meta-study:",

It's easy to fall into the comparison trap, judging your progress against others.\n\nBut the truth is, you're not behind at all.\n\nHere are 8 reasons why:\n\n1/ Your timeline is unique to you\n↳ Comparing your progress to others’ is a recipe for frustration.\n↳ Everyone moves at their own pace - trust your journey.\n\n2/ Growth isn’t always visible\n↳ Some growth happens behind the scenes.\n↳ You’re always evolving, even when it’s not obvious to others.\n\n3/ Life doesn’t follow a set path\n↳ Success isn’t linear - there are many roads to the same destination.\n↳ Flexibility and adaptation are key to thriving, not following someone else’s rules.\n\n4/ You’ve already made progress\n↳ It’s easy to forget how far you’ve come when you focus on where you want to be.\n↳ Take time to celebrate how much you’ve achieved so far.\n\n5/ Failures don’t define you\n↳ Setbacks are lessons, not roadblocks.\n↳ Each failure brings you closer to success - embrace them as growth opportunities.\n\n6/ Time is relative\n↳ You don’t have to have everything figured out by a certain age.\n↳ Life is a marathon, not a sprint - take it at your own pace.\n\n7/ There’s no \"perfect\" time\n↳ Waiting for the \"perfect\" moment to start something can keep you stuck.\n↳ The right time is always now - take the first step today.\n\n8/ You’re where you need to be\n↳ Life unfolds as it’s meant to, and your path is uniquely yours.\n↳ Trust that you’re on the right track, even if you can’t see the entire journey yet.\n\nThe only person you should compare yourself to is you. How have you grown? What are you proud of? Progress takes patience, persistence and self-compassion. You've got this.\n\nRemember: You’re not behind - you’re exactly where you need to be.\n\nWhat part of your journey are you proud of?\n\n️ Please repost to help others.\n\n Follow mefor daily posts on mental health and personal development.",

        "content": "From winning leadership awards early to learning what leadership actually means decades later...\n\nFrom elementary school through university, I collected leadership awards.\n\nBack then, I thought being a leader was about being decisive and loud– charting a path, making decisions, and telling people what to do.\n\nLooking back now, I sometimes cringe thinking about it... I was not a leader – I was just a loud kid who refused to follow directions I didn't agree with.\n\nFast forward to today, after years of researching and working with industry experts and work-culture leaders, my perspective has completely transformed.\n\nLeadership isn't about standing out or charging ahead. It's not about being the loudest or most commanding voice in the room.\n\nIt isn't about you at all.\n\nTrue leadership is about empowering others to thrive.\n\nIt's about listening—really listening—and creating the space for others to grow, collaborate, and succeed.\n\nThe data backs this up:\n\n86% of employees who received meaningful feedback in the last week are fully engaged—compared to just 23% of workers overall. Active listening itself can increase collaboration and productivity by up to 25%.\n\nEven more telling: 80% of workplace conflicts stem from poor communication. But when leaders focus on active listening, employee satisfaction jumps by 30%.\n\nOver the years, I've learned three things little Jean didn't appreciate that actually transform bosses into inspiring and impactful leaders:\n\n Listen first, ask second.\nLeadership isn't about having all the answers—it's about understanding the questions. Active listening helps leaders uncover what their team truly needs to thrive.\n\n Empower, don't control.\nA leader's role is to bring out the best in others. This means assigning roles based on strengths, providing the resources to set them up for success, and trusting your people to do great work.\n\n Model collaboration.\nGreat leaders show their teams how to work together by practicing collaboration themselves—valuing diverse perspectives and making space for every voice at the table.\n\nAt Octopy, we bring this philosophy to life through human-focused leadership workshops, keynote speaking, and custom programming.\n\nWhat's one lesson that's transformed your understanding of leadership?\n\nLet's talk about it in the comments—I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

This is a lesson for any organization: solve problems efficiently, not extravagantly.\n\n 𝗚𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: The rise of transparent, open-source AI disrupts the monopolistic dominance of proprietary players and positions innovation as a global effort, including China’s growing leadership in cost-effective AI solutions.\n\n As DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, puts it: “The real gap isn’t a year or two; it’s the difference between originality and imitation.”\n\n◼️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆:\n\nDeepSeek’s disruptive impact isn’t just about technology—it’s about philosophy. Open-source, cost-effective AI is changing the game, leveling the playing field for businesses, and challenging traditional notions of what it takes to innovate.\n\nThe future of AI will be shaped by leaders who prioritize accessibility, agility, and openness.

Actually it can...\n\nSee waaay back when I started as a product marketer in b2b tech, I had a problem.\n\n→ As a product marketer, you're the expert in the product...\n→ AND you're the the expert in the audience.\n→ Because your job is to connect the two.\n\nYou'd think a product marketer in b2b tech -- 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘵 -- would have to be technical.\n\nHow else could you become the expert in a technical product?\n\nBut me? I had about as much technical talent as a crayon.\n\nDid that stop me? HELL NO!\n\nI leaned in on what I knew from back in my college days.\n\nAncient Greek Philosophy.\n\nAristole defined the ESSENCE of something as \"the what it was to be.\"\n\nI figured if I could get to the essence of the product, starting with the deepest level features and working my way up, then I could understand the product at its core.\n\nI could get to its essence.\n\nThat's when I came up with the three big rock questions at the center of everything I do today, working with founders and marketers to create their own killer messaging that attracts more of the right buyers.\n\nWhat I've learned after practicing this technique for more than 20 years is this:\n\nWhen you get to the essence of something, somethign cool happens.\n\n→ Explaining it\n→ Drawing analogies to it\n→ Creating content about it\n\n...all becomes second nature.\n\nBecause you understand it at its essence, you have the building blocks to create messaging that hits the mark no matter the audience, no matter the situation.\n\nI dove into all this a bit on the first episode of the newpodcast with my main man,.\n\nHere's a peek.\n\nListen to to entire episode TOMORROW (!!) wherever you dig podcasts.\n\n\n",

Most days, I’m all in. But let’s be real—there are tough days too.\n\nAfter a few years of doing this, I’ve learned how to hack the system. Here's what’s helped me keep my sanity:\n\n- 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗗𝗼𝘂𝗯𝘁: No senior to guide you? No problem. I set clear goals, track my own progress, and always have a backup plan. Pro tip: start small and build from there.\n\n- 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: When you’re the boss, the concept of \"personal time\" blurs. To stay on track without burning out, I set work hours, create a dedicated workspace, and use a calendar system.\n\n- 𝗘𝘅𝗵𝗮𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Doing everything yourself can drain you. I’ve learned to take short breaks after each task and occasionally outsource work to focus on what truly matters.\n\n- 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗙𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗲: Being the only creative brain behind your business can get tiring. When I hit a wall, I step away—whether it’s a walk, a nap, or blasting some music. Trust me, it works.\n\n- 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲: Early on, income was inconsistent, and the cash flow stress was real. I diversified my income and created a financial cushion to manage the ups and downs.\n\nYes, being self-employed can feel like a one-woman show. It can be exhausting, but honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way!",

In Western India, especially in cities like Pune and Nashik, I’ve seen many entrepreneurs, from independent filmmakers to digital marketers, face similar struggles. For instance, in Maharashtra’s growing start-up scene, founders juggle creative fatigue and financial uncertainty daily. A filmmaker in Kolhapur once told me that stepping away to explore nature helped him break creative blocks—something I relate to when writing. Whether it’s setting clear work boundaries or diversifying income, the key is to embrace the journey, knowing that every challenge shapes us into better leaders.",

I used to think networking was just about exchanging business cards or sending connection requests.\n\nBut over time, I realized that real connections are built through trust, value, and authenticity.\n\nHere are 4 skills that helped me build strong and genuine relationships:\n\n\n1. Active Listening\n\nI used to focus more on what to say next rather than truly listening. But when I started paying attention, asking follow-up questions, and showing genuine interest, conversations became deeper and more meaningful.\n\n- Studies show that good listeners are 40% more likely to build strong relationships because people feel valued and heard.\n\n\n2. Being Helpful Without Expectations\n\nInstead of reaching out only when I needed something, I started offering help—whether it was sharing a resource, giving feedback, or introducing people to the right connections.\n\nAccording to research, people who give without expecting immediate returns build stronger long-term networks.\n\n\n3. Sharing My Experiences Openly\n\nI used to hesitate to share my struggles and lessons, thinking they weren’t valuable. But when I started sharing my journey—both wins and failures—I noticed more people resonated with me.\n\nAuthenticity creates trust, and trust builds meaningful connections.\n\n\n4. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)\n\nI worked on understanding people’s emotions, responding with empathy, and adapting my communication style.\n\nResearch shows that people with high EQ are 3x more successful in building lasting relationships because they make others feel understood and valued.\n\n\nRemember, Networking isn’t just about numbers; it’s about genuine relationships that grow over time.\n\n\nDo you agree?\n\nFollowfor more.",

That’s whyand I are excited to addto the City Lifestyle family as the Sales Director for Ramapo Valley! Mike has been out there making connections and, in just three weeks, he’s nearly 50% toward launching revenue. I needed a true hunter to get this publication off the ground, and Mike is exactly the guy for the job. I only hire unicorns and Mike is no exception. Ask me about his Culture Index profile!\n\nFun fact: Although Mike was born and raised in Canada  (and we never let him forget it!), he’s called New Jersey home for over 20 years—yes, he chose NJ! Below is a fun shot of Mike with his groomsmen from his wedding last June. When you have a great picture like that, you use every chance to show it off. \n\nWelcome to the team, Mike. If you’re not used to a little razzing yet, you’ll get accustomed quickly—after all, we work hard, play hard, and never take ourselves too seriously. \nHere’s to growth, success, and plenty of good times ahead at!

        "content": "BIOMIMICRY CONTINUUM – Part 4 – Update Agent LEARNING\n Fundamental evidence of learning is the ability to recall and utilize what is learned. Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (all links in my comment below)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3 of this series.\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",
