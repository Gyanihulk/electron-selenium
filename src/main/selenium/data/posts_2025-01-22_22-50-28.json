      "content": "Today \nhashtag\n#CyberTalent spotlight is on Ana Isabel Ayerbe Fern√°ndez-Cuesta\n\nWhat was your original career path and how did you end up in the cyber security field?\n\nI studied computer science and obtained an MSC in Robotics and Automation, so my original career was oriented towards the industrial application of new technologies. I¬¥ve always been enthusiastic about new technologies and the opportunities they could bring, but at the same\ntime couldn¬¥t avoid thinking about the potential risks of someone making bad use of them.\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è What is the most appealing thing to you about working in cyber security?\n\nA feeling of doing something good for society when trying to build new products, services and systems with built-in cyber security or training people to be better prepared to make safe use of the digital systems and services or when trying to stop or minimize the impact of cyber attacks at different levels.\n\n Name a book/movie that has inspired you. Anything specific to cyber security that you would recommend?\n\nThe film ‚ÄúMinority Report‚Äù showed many different aspects of a potential future, with ubiquitous technology taking a lot of decisions on behalf of people. It was a threatening future with many security- and privacy-related issues not well solved. The book ‚Äú1984‚Äù by George Orwell, showing the risks of massive surveillance, has also been an inspiration for me.\n\n I recommend you to follow her , like and comment on this post to share her example, and perhaps suggest others to showcase !\n\n>>> This profile is part of a series I‚Äôm publishing every other day in collaboration with @Women4Cyber Foundation, follow me to receive the next updates.",

You've got a general sense of where you need to go, but the path forward is anything but straightforward.\n\nThe true mark of an exceptional leader isn't their ability to predict every twist and turn but rather their capacity to adapt, experiment, and keep their team focused on the end goal.\n\nHow effective are you in leading through change? Ask yourself:\n\n‚Ä¢ How do you typically respond when faced with uncertainty or a lack of clear direction as a leader?\n‚Ä¢ What strategies do you employ to stay calm, creative, and adaptable in high-pressure situations?\n‚Ä¢ How can you cultivate a mindset and culture that embraces ambiguity as an opportunity for growth and innovation?\n\nRegardless of how you answered, here are 3 ways to sharpen your skills and master the art of leading through ambiguity:\n\n1.) Empower Your Team:\nDelegate responsibilities and tap your team's diverse talents to tackle challenges.\n\n2.) Keep the Big Picture in Sight:\nMaintain a laser-sharp focus on the ultimate end goal to guide decision-making.\n\n3.) Celebrate Small Wins:\nRecognize and appreciate the incremental progress you and your team make.\n\nBy embracing the chaos, empowering your people, and maintaining a steadfast commitment to your objectives, you can transform even the most daunting leadership challenge into an opportunity to showcase your true adaptability and problem-solving prowess.\n\nStay inspired, and followfor more.\n--\nCoaching works; let's work together.\n Book Your Coaching Discovery Session Today:",
