Just a straight-up calendar invite dropped into my inbox for a webinar about \"Tackling the Supply Chain Talent Shortage.\"\n\nHere's the kicker:\n I’ve never spoken to this company.\n I definitely didn’t opt in to anything.\n The explanation for why I should care is all inside the invite.\n\nMy initial thoughts:\n🟢 It’s bold. Credit where credit is due. Nobody just drops calendar invites out of the blue like this. It’s outside the box, and it definitely got my attention.\n🟡 But is it effective? This isn’t a pain point for me, so I won’t be joining the call. But if it was a relevant topic, would I feel differently? Would this approach work better than a traditional email?\n There’s something about skipping the usual prospecting dance (cold email > follow-up > nudge) that feels refreshing... but also a little intrusive.\n\nSo now I’m torn. Should this be roasted for being a hard miss, or celebrated for creativity?\n\nMy questions to all of you:\n Has anyone else tried this tactic?\n Did it work?\n How would you feel if you got an invite like this?",
