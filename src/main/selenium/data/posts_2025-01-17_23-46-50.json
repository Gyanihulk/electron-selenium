It’s one that behaves predictably and safely, even in edge cases or unfamiliar scenarios. But not all errors are equal—the severity of failure depends entirely on business context.\n\nA creative AI generating a mildly offbeat response? 𝐋𝐨𝐰 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐤.\nAn AI system in finance or healthcare misinterpreting data? 𝐏𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐡𝐢𝐜.\n\nTo ensure true reliability, we need a structured, multidisciplinary approach that evaluates AI within the right business context. This means:\n️ Defining operational constraints based on risk tolerance and business impact.\n️ Quantifying and mitigating errors with a risk-severity framework.\n️ Establishing clear boundaries to prevent high-severity failures.\n\nThis boundary-driven approach ties back to my Ph.D. research in neuromotor control, where stability and predictability were essential in modeling movement. Biological systems self-regulate within constraints to prevent failure—AI systems must do the same.\n\nThis is why I take a multidisciplinary approach—pulling from risk management, control theory, and real-world business applications—to design safeguards that prevent AI from operating outside safe limits. Businesses adopting AI can’t afford to treat reliability as an afterthought. It has to be built into the system from the start.\n\n How does your industry approach AI failures? Do you see structured safeguards in place, or is it still mostly reactive? Let’s discuss.",

      "content": "\"Why UPSC?\"—The Most Overused Yet Tricky Question!\n\nIf I had a rupee for every time a mock interview panel asked me this question, I’d have enough to retire and not need UPSC at all.\n\nPicture this: You walk into the interview room, nerves intact, dreams in place, and the panel drops the question—“Why do you want to leave your high-paying job for UPSC?” Cue awkward silence and your brain playing the Jeopardy theme.\n\nAt first, I thought I nailed it:\n\"To contribute to society!\" – Too vague.\n\"Dreaming of public service since childhood!\" – Too cheesy.\n\"To make a real difference!\" – Too predictable.\n\nSpoiler alert: None of it worked. The panelists still looked at me like I was trading a Lamborghini for a bicycle.\n\nEnter my friend, who clearly had enough of my existential crisis. He said, “Bro, go watch Aditya Shrivastava’s interview—AIR 1, UPSC 2023. The man left a 50 LPA Goldman Sachs job and owned that question.”\n\nSo I did. And let me tell you—his answer was a masterclass in simplicity and logic. He basically said, “It’s not about what I’m leaving behind; it’s about what I’m stepping into. The private sector builds, but the civil services shape. That’s the kind of impact I want.”\n\nBoom. Mic drop. Interview cracked.\n\nNow, as I sit here trying to carve out my own “magic bullet” answer, I thought, why not turn to my LinkedIn fam?\n\nWhat would YOU say if someone asked you this question? Why choose UPSC over unicorn startups, FAANG jobs, or even high packages?\n\nFor me, it’s the chance to:\n\nWork on transformative issues like poverty, education, and infrastructure.\n\nHelp craft policies that impact millions.\n\nMaintain international relations that define our global presence.\n\nAnd yes, to be part of something bigger than myself.\n\n\nBut enough about me—your turn! Drop your wittiest, smartest, or most heartfelt answer in the comments. Bonus points if it’s funny (I need all the help I can get before my next mock).\n\nLet’s crack this question together—one clever answer at a time. Who knows, your perspective might just help me land that IAS tag someday!",

Civil services offer roles in governance, policymaking, and global relations, with new challenges every day.\n\n2. Variety of Work:Unlike the repetitive private sector or other government departments like SSC CGL and PSUs, civil services offer dynamic work. One day it’s fieldwork; the next, policy-making or managing systems. There’s never a dull moment.\n\n3. Inspired by the System:Many issues arise from gaps in governance. UPSC offers a chance to bring change, and sometimes we also think that if we were there, we could do it in a better way.\n\n4. A Platform for Change:Being an IAS officer means influencing policies and solving problems—bigger than personal ambition. You have the power to save the law, help the people of the nation, and execute things in a better way, having the authority to make them the best.\n\n5. Mixed Motivations for Becoming an IAS:\nNot everyone joins the IAS to serve the nation. Some seek power, respect, and the main thing is corruption. In North India, IAS is pursued for prestige and societal pressure to become a 'collector,' with some motivated by power or corruption. (5th point is my thinking)",
