Your measurement system is!\n\n\nI recently had a great conversation with my amazing friend(Sandler Calgary President, Author, and Sales Leadership Coach) about a framework most sales leaders ignore: measuring role play effectiveness through conversion ratios.\n\n\nHere's the reality check: You can't improve what you don't measure, and \"soft skills\" don't mean unmeasurable results.\n\n\nKey insights from our discussion:\n\n- Track ratio improvements between each sales stage (e.g., demo-to-proposal etc)\n- Small improvements compound - a 10% boost in one conversion metric can significantly impact overall results\n- Combine quantitative metrics with qualitative field observations\n- Give your team time to implement changes - coaching isn't a one-time event\n\n\nIn the full episode, we covered:\n\n- Why group role plays might be hurting your team more than helping\n- The psychology behind effective 1:1 role play sessions\n- How AI is transforming sales practice and coaching\n- Why top performers need different types of role play scenarios\n- The \"leader models first\" framework for building trust\n\n\nCheck out the full conversation in the comments ",

        "content": "An ETP (Effluent Treatment Plant) is a facility designed to treat wastewater generated from industrial processes before it is discharged into the environment or reused. The primary goal of an ETP is to remove contaminants and pollutants to meet regulatory standards for effluent discharge. Here's an overview of its components and working:\nKey Components\nPreliminary Treatment: This stage includes screening and grit removal to eliminate large solids and debris that could damage equipment.\nPrimary Treatment: In this phase, sedimentation tanks are used to settle out heavier solids. This helps in reducing the suspended solids and organic load.\nSecondary Treatment: This biological treatment stage uses microorganisms to degrade organic matter. Common methods include:\nActivated Sludge Process: Air is introduced to mix wastewater with microorganisms.\nBiofilm Processes: Bacteria grow on surfaces (e.g., trickling filters) to treat wastewater.\nTertiary Treatment: This advanced treatment phase targets remaining contaminants, including nutrients and pathogens. Methods may include filtration, chemical treatment, or disinfection.\nSludge Management: The residual sludge from the treatment processes is further processed (e.g., anaerobic digestion, dewatering) for disposal or reuse.\nBenefits\nEnvironmental Protection: Reduces pollution and protects water bodies from industrial effluents.\nWater Reuse: Treated water can be reused for various applications, such as irrigation or industrial processes.\nRegulatory Compliance: Helps industries meet environmental regulations and standards.\nETPs are crucial for sustainable industrial practices, ensuring that wastewater is treated effectively before it impacts the environment.",

Although they were marveled by the demos, few saw the connection to their day to day life.\n\nContrast that to my classes this week. Many come from organizations actively deploying novel generative AI tools, with maturing AI governance structures and working groups. About half the class are already using AI for at least 10% of their tasks, and a good number are using it for more than a quarter of their work.\n\nI was blown away by the quality of questions and the depth of the discussion.

Founders worry they won’t get another investment offer. Investors hesitate to cut losses on a failing bet. Executives hold onto outdated strategies, hoping they’ll eventually work.\n\nI’ve seen founders accept bad deals because they feared they wouldn’t get another. The wrong investor can derail your business more than no investor at all.\n\nI’ve seen investors double down on losses instead of pivoting their capital to higher-impact ventures. Sunk-cost fallacy is real.\n\nI’ve seen companies cling to outdated strategies, pouring millions into marketing campaigns that no longer resonate with their audience.\n\nThe smartest move sometimes is to pivot or pull back.\n\nSaying no is just as powerful as saying yes.\n\nGreat founders, investors, and business leaders know this: Walking away isn’t failure but strategy.\nI've spent my career as an expert building brands, transforming companies and helping executives and founders conduct turnarounds to achieve accelerated growth. Let's just say, my experience is like a PhD in business success.\n\nWhat’s one decision you made to walk away that ultimately paid off? Drop it in the comments. ",

Resistance only clouds creative solutions.\n\n3️⃣ Reframe the Problem: A fresh perspective can reveal opportunities you never saw before.\n\n4️⃣ Break It Down: Overwhelming challenges become manageable when tackled piece by piece.\n\n5️⃣ Take Steady Steps: Progress isn’t about grand leaps—it’s built on consistent, deliberate action.\n\n6️⃣ Seek Support: A fresh perspective can lighten the load and open doors to innovative solutions.\n\nNext time you feel stuck, pause and ask: How can I flow with this? The answer might just surprise you.\n\n Have you ever solved a problem by shifting your approach? Drop your thoughts below! \n\n\n Inspire your network - repost to spread the power of resilience.\n\nFollow mefor more.\n\n Clap for the boy who climbed out of the hole and  subscribe for incredible videos: DnD_Eng",

They created powerful machines that transformed how businesses shared information and worked together.\n\nApollo’s success caught the eye of Hewlett-Packard, and they acquired the company for a whopping $476 million in 1989.\n\nWhat made Apollo special was their vision: To bring advanced computing to the workplace in a way that made teams more productive and connected.\n\nSound familiar? It’s the same mindset that drives modern tools like Microsoft 365 and OneDrive.\n\nWhile Apollo’s brand name may have faded out over time, their influence lives on in the way businesses use technology to work smarter today.\n\nHow is tech helping your business to innovate and collaborate?",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

He was terminated after only 10 months of employment after being assured his job was safe.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Randy and the rest of his team received no leads as they were all quietly and underhandedly funneled to another team by another manager.\n\nRandy fought and complained about this for weeks as he had no leads to work. He was assured any poor performance for the quarter would not be held against him and they would fix the lead allocation process moving forward.\n\nHe was terminated within 2 weeks after the assurances were made. Randy was offered only two weeks’ severance despite assurances he will have at least another quarter to perform given the unfair lack of opportunity.\n\nWas Randy set up for failure to be fired?\n\nWas he terminated because he exposed the lead manipulations and continued to complain about it?\n\nWho knows, but whatever it was, he did not deserve to be terminated after just 10 months of employment with how things went down.\n\nWe had a call, and I shared some strategies and tactics he should use to get a better offer.

Prof. Ravindran highlights why this breakthrough is such a big win for India!\n\nDeepSeek’s Mixture-of-Experts approach activates only a fraction of the model, significantly reducing computational costs, thus, by implementing aggressive quantization down to 4-bit precision, it lowers memory and processing power requirements, making AI more resource-efficient. Moreover, their focus on smarter inference through efficient reinforcement learning ensures, that fewer resources are needed for accurate results. The open-source access provided by DeepSeek also empowers Indian researchers and startups, creating vast opportunities for innovation.\n\nThese advancements make AI more accessible, positioning India to compete globally. At IIT Madras, we are already developing evaluation frameworks for GenAI models tailored to India, ensuring AI is fair, robust, and applicable to real-world needs.\n\nWhat do you think this means for India's AI future?\n\nRead the full interview here:.",

IMO, DeepSeek is a decent effort, and it does not matter.",

No more tool toggling. Just one AI that adapts in real-time.\n\nThis is the move OpenAI needed to make. imo\n\n\nRight now, AI’s biggest barrier isn’t capability…it’s friction. Complexity. Confusion.\n\nMake AI effortless, and adoption skyrockets.\n\n↳ One model that knows when to reason deeply vs. answer fast\n\n↳ One UI that integrates search, voice, vision, and action\n\n↳ One system that “just works”\n\nIt’s the closest thing we’ve seen to true AI fluidity.\n\nAnd the best part? GPT-5 will be free.\n(Not all features, of course, but the base model is unlimited.)\n\nThoughts? Does this fix the biggest pain points for you? ",

To address these challenges, he introduced a structured framework that begins with onboarding data to ensure AI systems have access to relevant organizational knowledge.\n\nThis is followed by engineering pre-processing and retrieval strategies to refine query handling, improving AI performance through user feedback, and ensuring transparency by incorporating citations to build trust and accountability.\nHe emphasized the importance of metadata, domain knowledge, user personas, and conversation history in refining AI-generated insights.\n\nAdditionally, Pranshu introduced autonomous agents and real-time data integration, demonstrating how these advancements can enhance operational efficiency within the aviation sector.",

Say What?!?!?!?\n\nWe collectively have allowed it to get to where it has gone.\n\nEmployees who are wronged or victimized by their employer and continue to allow it to happen or just walk away in silence are encouraging the employer to continue to do it.\n\nWhen they steal your commission and you accept it with little push back, you’re inviting it to happen again. You are rewarding them. You are making it financially more lucrative to do the wrong thing.\n\nThey get away with it because we let them.\n\nThey’ve done it for so long they don’t even give it a second thought. It becomes second nature. They can detach the human consequences of their actions and how it impacts the employees who have shown up for them every day for years or even decades.\n\nIt is a mental illness to be able to do so. Narcissists. Sociopaths. Lacking a conscious and humanity and fairness. Sadly, this represents way too many leaders in the corporate world, who BTW are proud of it.\n\nIt’s time to expose them and their harmful actions that cause permanent scars on their victims. You know what makes these bullies cower? Do you know what their kryptonite is? Public exposure. It is their greatest fear.\n\nIt is your right to share your truthful experience. You have no obligation to hide their wrongdoing and abuse. In fact, I would say the opposite. We all have an obligation to protect and warn each other from the abuse of these so-called leaders.\n\nIt’s time for employees to stop walking away feeling like a victim and carrying that regret for years or decades or forever. Document, call it out, confront it, be heard.\n\nHold them accountable for their actions. It could be one of the most empowering things you do in your life.",

This country was built on stolen land and stolen labor. The American way was to receive what was never yours and exploit those who had no choice.\n\nAt its core, America is transactional. From the beginning, success was defined by how much one could take while giving as little as possible in return. This mindset shaped our economy, our institutions, and even our culture. It is why negotiation, leverage, and self-interest are seen as virtues. It is why maximizing profit and minimizing cost is the guiding principle of American business.\n\nThis same transactional mindset fuels how employers treat workers today. Companies squeeze employees for every ounce of productivity while paying as little as they can get away with. They preach loyalty while offering none in return. The absurd behaviors of employers stem from the transactional mindset. Employees are seen as assets to be optimized, not people to be valued. Just as in the past, those with power extract as much as possible from those without, all while insisting that’s just the way things are.",

We start as strangers, exchanging thoughts through posts and comments, and slowly, it feels less like networking and more like a community. A place where we celebrate wins, share lessons, and sometimes just check in on each other.\n\nIt’s easy to see LinkedIn as just a professional space, but at its core, it’s about people. Real connections, real stories, and real impact.\n\nHave you ever made a connection here that felt like more than just another LinkedIn contact? Would love to hear your experience. ",

Real Estate is a trap for most people.\n\nLook it is an incredible way to build wealth.\n\nIt is also an incredible way to add complexity, create headaches, and earn less than you should.\n\n2. Most people don't know what they want.\n\nWe make money and all we want is more. Ask someone why and they usually say something like \"a better life\".\n\nAsk what \"a better life\" looks like and most struggle to define it.\n\n3. Financial advice is amplified through shared experiences.\n\nMost people don't need someone to tell them basic money strategy.\n\nThey need an intellectual sparring partner not to make the big mistake (spending too little, spending too much, taking on unnecessary risk)\n\n4. Money changes people.\n\nNo, it doesn't turn you into a terrible person.\n\nIt amplifies your connections, changes your circle, and gives you experiences that change your viewpoint on life.\n\n5. The smartest people don't make the most money.\n\nIgnore the outlier cases (Zuckerberg and Musk), the richest people realized this:\n\nEveryone puts their pants on the same way ~ if they can do it so can you.\n\n6. The happiest people are not the richest.\n\nThe greatest thing money can do is provide peace of mind and control of your time.\n\nThe desire for more is a drug and the only cure is understanding what is enough.\n\n7. No one wins an award for dying with the most money.\n\nContrary to how many people live their lives, there is no medal stand at death.\n\nThere are the people you impacted, the contributions you made, and the things you helped make better.\n\n8. The best way for most people to make money is boring.\n\nNews flash you don't need to be on the Forbes 30 under 30 list for some new breakthrough.\n\nBuying a boring small business, spend less than you make, invest in a diversified portfolio ~ It works.\n\n9. The shiniest pitches should be avoided.\n\nHow does a casino pay for a nice building? By luring you in with shiny objects.\n\nThe same is true for most pitches ~ lavish pitches to get you to buy/invest is a red flag.\n\n10. You should come up with your list.\n\nThese are my experiences with money.\n\nMy experiences are .00000001% of all the experiences out there ~ create your list and stick by it.\n\n-\n\n If you find this helpful, please share it with your network ️ and follow me for more ways to get smarter with your money.

Back then people were wowed by chatbots' conversational abilities and mimicry of linguistic fluency, and hence underappreciated the limitations. Now people are wowed by the \"report\" format of Deep Research outputs and its mimicry of authoritativeness, and underappreciate the difficulty of fact-checking 10-page papers. So I think some of the initial excitement will fade (which is not to deny that the tool is extremely useful).\n\nA subtle but more important reason to be excited about Deep Research is that it represents one of the first attempts to merge the two main directions of progress beyond model scaling, namely reasoning and agentic capabilities, and thus sets an extremely low bar for what reasoning agents are capable of. There is lots of low hanging fruit ahead.",

Why should we not be proud of the open source leaders that will likely come out of China now? Why should we not be impressed by DeepSeek? A company founded in 2023 a full 8 years after OpenAI. Have you looked into the pace of iteration and either Qwen or their lab? It makes the billions that Meta has put into this look fragile.\n\nSo Silicon Valley is going to have to ban all of them just to create a moat? It was in May 2023 that the Google employee warned us of there not being moat.\n\nNo, no let's actually look deeper into the implications of what this means.",

GPT-5 won’t just replace GPT-4 - it will absorb all specialized tools (voice, coding, research) into a single, autonomous system. Your AI will decide for you when to think deeply, act fast, or dig into your data.\n\n Convenience… or control? Autonomous… or human-level thinking?\n\n2️⃣ GPT-4.5 (Orion) is presented as a “bridge” to GPT-5. But insiders whisper it’s a downgraded stopgap - originally pitched as GPT-5 before technical failures and $2B+ in compute costs forced a rebrand.\n\n Is this progress… or panic? Is this a really good product… or an untested version released to compete with Chinese models?\n\n3️⃣ Free for all - unlimited GPT-5 for free users sounds generous and super awesome. But do they have a choice with the competition pushing boundaries of opensource?\n\n It looks like they want to dominate the market by flooding it with “standard” AI, while locking advanced reasoning behind Plus/Pro paywalls. A monopoly in disguise... or a standard business strategy?\n\nWhat’s in it for us?\n\n Stronger models for free or for a small cost\n\n More marketing around AGI - which is good for AI startups\n\n And unfortunately even more confusion among people, that will get more and more scared of AGI enigma\n\n Layoffs are coming - whether they’ll be disguised as AGI or Agents or the next Unified LLM - this will result in people losing their jobs.\n\nWhat’s your take - is the\na real thing\nOR\nis this pure marketing, trying to catch up with Chinese competitors?",
