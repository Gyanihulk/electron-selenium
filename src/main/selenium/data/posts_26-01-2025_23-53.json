Literally. Research it, learn all about it. Find out what your options and rights are. Get it all set up and ready to go and then drop it on your employer before they can pull the rug out from under you.\n\nI have heard from more than 30 people who have experienced this. Opening up with their manager “friend” or HR business “partner” to then have that information used against them.\n\nShare as little as possible for as long as possible and when the time comes, make sure you can’t be blindsided by your employer’s reaction.\n\np.s. HR trolls, I am not suggesting fraud. I am not suggesting people take advantage of medical leave. I am not suggesting anything lacking character, integrity, or that will impact employees future job prospects. These benefits and rights exist and it is the employees right to utilize them when appropriate to do so. Even if it screws up your plans to terminate them.",

I became her primary caregiver. My PTO that year depleted quickly.\n\nI was incredibly fortunate that Jolene, my manager at Wake Forest University, suggested I look into Intermittent FMLA. I was able to take unpaid time off to care for my mom without fearing I’d lose my job. I was very lucky, thankful, grateful, etc. to have such a caring and empathetic manager. I felt valued, if that makes sense.\n\nThere ARE a handful of employers out there who value their employees. Those employers are hard to find these days.\n\nIt is unfortunate that many employers lack human decency and empathy. Employees to them are not human beings, but only cogs in a wheel that can easily be replaced.",

𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗻𝗼. \n𝗕𝗿𝘂𝗰𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗲 𝘀𝗮𝗶𝗱, ‘𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗺𝗲'.\n\n𝘞𝘦𝘭𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘦𝘦𝘬’𝘴\n—𝘢 𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘦𝘦𝘬 𝘢𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘥.\n\nBruce Lee wasn’t just a martial artist or a movie star—he was a visionary who redefined success.\n\nAs a boy in Hong Kong, Bruce was attacked by a gang. That moment could have left him broken, but instead, it ignited his lifelong pursuit of martial arts. 𝗬𝗲𝘁 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘆, 𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. Traditional styles felt rigid and impractical.\n\nWhat many dont know is that Bruce had physical limitations: one leg was an inch shorter and his eyesight was minus 10. Yet he practiced relentlessly, throwing 5,000 punches a day.\n\nSo, he did what few dared: he created his own. 𝗛𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆, 𝗝𝗲𝗲𝘁 𝗞𝘂𝗻𝗲 𝗗𝗼, 𝘄𝗮𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴—𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁.\n\n\"𝘈𝘣𝘴𝘰𝘳𝘣 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘧𝘶𝘭, 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘥 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘥𝘥 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘲𝘶𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘰𝘸𝘯.\"\n\nBruce wasn’t just about physical power—𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗿, 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝟮,𝟱𝟬𝟬 𝗯𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 on philosophy, psychology & self-improvement, believing true mastery united body and mind.\n\n𝗛𝗼𝗹𝗹𝘆𝘄𝗼𝗼𝗱 presented its own fight. As an Asian actor, Bruce was sidelined as “exotic” or typecast. 𝗗𝗼𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗱𝗶𝗱𝗻’𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝘀𝗵𝘂𝘁—𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱.\n\nInstead of waiting for permission to succeed, Bruce flowed around the obstacles. He choreographed, directed, and redefined what it meant to be an Asian actor in films like The Big Boss and Enter the Dragon. His \"Be like water\" philosophy wasn’t just words—it was action.\n\n“𝘞𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴𝘯’𝘵 𝘧𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘰𝘣𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘤𝘭𝘦𝘴; 𝘪𝘵 𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘸𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮, 𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘵𝘩 𝘢𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘥.”\n\nThe world that once rejected him now honors him with statues, recognition in 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗴𝗮𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗲’𝘀 “𝟭𝟬𝟬 𝗠𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗹𝘂𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝟮𝟬𝘁𝗵 𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘂𝗿𝘆,” and a legacy that inspires millions.\n\n 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻: When traditional methods don’t work for you, challenge them. Like Bruce’s Jeet Kune Do, greatness comes from rethinking the rules and adding what’s uniquely yours.\n\n𝗦𝗼, 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗿𝘂𝗹𝗲, 𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻?

Culture is everything.\n\nWhy? Because thriving at work is about the long game.\nIt’s about waking up excited, not dragging yourself to a toxic workplace.\n\nNo paycheck is worth sacrificing your peace of mind.\n\nIt’s better to have a job that doesn’t fit your dream title but nourishes your growth, than to wear a “dream title” that fills your life with toxicity.\n\nFulfillment. Growth. Well-being. That’s what truly matters.\n\nChoosing your growth isn’t selfish—it’s essential. It’s how you unlock the best version of yourself.\n\nYou absolutely deserve that version of YOU.",

Nothing like the whole \"burn the ships\" strategy to light a fire under you!\n\nBut more importantly, since I couldn't hire help it forced me to roll up my sleeves and do everything myself.\n\nI had to be disciplined, and I got used to writing/creating content every day. And with practice I got more clear on my message and what I wanted my business to be about.\n\nI mention this to give encouragement to you if you're in the position I was once in and can't afford to throw boatloads of money hiring help or into ads.\n\nMy method in growing a coaching business is effective and it's been tested in the field over many years ...\n\nBut full disclosure: it does require work!\n\nDetails in the comments:",

The more you improve, the more people notice your work.\n\nAnd noticed work? That’s where the money’s at.\n\nKeeps You Relevant.Trends change, styles evolve, if you’re not learning, you’re falling behind, for real.\n\nBoosts Confidence. Knowing your stuff makes you feel like you belong. Confidence = better output.\n\nBut How to Keep Learning???\n\n1. Read Everything. From novels to blogs, read widely.\n\nIt’s the easiest way to pick up new ideas and techniques.\n\n\n2.Experiment. Try new genres, styles, or formats.\n\nYou learn the most when you step out of your comfort zone.\n\n\n3.Take Feedback Seriously.\n\nCriticism helps you see blind spots you didn’t know were there.\n\n\n4.And lastly just Stay Curious Man. Keep asking, \"How can I do this better?\"\n\nThat mindset is what takes you places.\n\n\nThe Payoff\n\nLearning more doesn’t just level up your writing it opens doors.\n\nWhether it’s new gigs, publishing opportunities, or\n\njust writing something you’re proud of, the effort is always worth it.\n\n\nYea Remember, the more you invest in yourself, the more it pays off.\n\nSo, keep learning, keep growing, and watch how it changes the game for you.",

It’s in the challenges we face, the people we meet, and the experiences we gather along the way that life truly unfolds.\n\nThe destination may provide satisfaction, but it’s the path that shapes who we are and gives us stories to cherish forever. As they say, \"The journey is the reward.\"",
