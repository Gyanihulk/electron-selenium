In fact,did you write this article?\n\nInteresting how different groups label these assets. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúoffice-warehouse‚Äù and we call them ‚Äúflex industrial.‚Äù This article uses ‚Äúsmall bay‚Äù and ‚Äúlast mile.‚Äù\n\nFrom an acquisition side, hey, I like the confusion, our group is able to secure these assets below intrinsic value because, let‚Äôs be honest, they aren‚Äôt always the shiniest rocks in the pond.\n\nBut they are where business is done. E-commerce, HVAC, pest control, start ups that haven‚Äôt gotten to the point of being able to afford buying their own space.\n\nAnd this class wasn‚Äôt really being built for the last 20 years or so.\n\nGlad to work with Grant,and the team.\n\nRead the article and let me know what you think.",

      "content": "Meet the team.\n\nExtraordinary people solving extraordinary problems means doing extraordinary things.\n\nWe are built to last because ofas CTO andas Founding Engineer, together leading our engineering efforts.\n\nWe are positioned for a uniquely special product market fit withand her team as she leads product.\n\nBehind the scenes working closely with me is, my Chief of Staff and administrative wizard.\n\nAnd just this week after advising us the last year,has officially hiredas Head of Sales full-time, helping us grow.\n\nTogether as a team, we have some big announcements you'll start to see over the next few weeks as we execute on our rollout plans.\n\nBut I want to say 2 things before this snowball of progress truly takes off.\n\n1. You won't regret living your values\n\nWe won't win because we are the smartest or the most advanced, or the most well funded, or the most connected.\n\nWe are going to impact things because we have cared about actually solving a real problem since Day 1.\n\nLast year after Unleash, we had over $1.5 million in sales pipeline, much of it progressing to close quickly. And as I was about to close deals, I found egregious errors that led me to realize, \"We gotta pull the plug.\"\n\nWe didn't sell software, on purpose.\n\nThis last year was a year of rebuilding following that. We made personnel changes. We redid the entire code base from end to end. We revamped our calculations.\n\nAnd now, we are bulletproof.\n\nThat delay brought stress.\n\nWe still sold services.\n\nBut we demonstrated we don't trade integrity for anything at OneView.\n\nWe make impact through data-driven analysis.\n\nThat starts with our willingness to be patient and make sound decisions, or else how can we help our customers do that?\n\n2nd point: You won't regret deeply creative thinking\n\nAs a consultancy turned productized bootstrapped startup, we have gotten \"around\" many norms and stipulations startups face.\n\nWe avoided big funding rounds, inflated valuations, unneeded dilution, and constant scrutiny of the plans we have been making before we \"knew it cold.\"\n\nNow we do, and the path has never been clearer.\n\nWe must always demand of ourselves the type of innovation we never thought was possible.\n\nWe have used every flavor of AI and technology imaginable, without yet needing certain full-time hires for unneeded things.\n\nAnd already we have analysis capabilities that quite literally don't exist anywhere else in the entire market (prove me wrong, I'll show you).\n\nWhat we sell next will change markets.\n\nBut the quality in that process is not just the outcome, it's the process itself.\n\nPeople say the destination is the journey, which can sound like excusing failure.\n\nFor my part, I believe living our values and thinking creatively are a journey that must be taken if the ultimate destination is to be achieved.\n\nWho is ready to come and see what we have been cooking up?",

      "content": "When I face the daily struggles of being an entrepreneur, it‚Äôs often because I‚Äôm juggling multiple roles and responsibilities simultaneously.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, you‚Äôre the visionary, the executor, the marketer, the accountant, and sometimes even the customer support agent. This constant context-switching, coupled with the pressure to deliver results, can make every day feel like a marathon.\n\nHere‚Äôs what helps me manage this overwhelming chaos:\n\nBreaking my day into focused time blocks and prioritizing tasks that align with my long-term goals.\n\nThe traditional advice of ‚Äújust work harder‚Äù or ‚Äúhustle 24/7‚Äù has not worked for me.\n\nHere‚Äôs what has worked for me:\n\n1) I jot down my top three priorities for the next day and schedule specific time slots for deep work.\n2) I‚Äôve realized that trying to do everything myself leads to burnout. Instead, I delegate tasks that others can handle so I can focus on high-impact activities.\n3) Entrepreneurship often feels like an endless grind, but I‚Äôve learned that taking breaks, exercising, and spending time with loved ones actually makes me more productive.\n\nThis process works because it creates structure in the chaos, reduces decision fatigue, and allows me to focus my energy where it matters most. Over time, I‚Äôve found myself less reactive and more intentional in how I approach challenges.\n\nAs Warren Buffett famously said, ‚ÄúThe difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.‚Äù\n\nThis quote resonates deeply with me because it underscores the importance of prioritization and focus, which are critical in navigating the entrepreneurial journey.\n\nWhat about you? How do you handle the daily challenges of entrepreneurship? Do you have a specific strategy that works wonders for you? Let‚Äôs share and grow together!",

Fun fact: I honestly have no idea what 99.9% of people here are selling or are even doing so you can keep talking about your sales funnels, leads, and amazing value propositions, but if I don't like your personality or vibe I'm probably never going to want to speak to you or do business with you.

Many of us feel a deep sense of loss.\n\nOver the last several years, I have spent a lot of time and energy talking about DEI ‚Äì what it is and what it is not (I‚Äôm sure you can find at least several dozen articles and posts that I have written about this). I‚Äôve entertained debates and questions and commentary. I‚Äôve done my best to educate, in whatever small ways that I can.\n\nToday, I don‚Äôt want to do that.\n\nInstead, I want to reach out to all of you who care about belonging, inclusion, fairness, equity, diversity ‚Äì there are many of you. Some of you are DEI professionals, but many of you are people who simply build these values into your daily lives‚Äîyour families, your communities, your workplaces.\n\nTo all of you, I want to say several things.\n\nFirst, you are not alone. We are all walking this path together. Our arms are locked and we will continue to march. You may feel isolated at times. But, you do not need to do any of this on your own.\n\nSecond, stay optimistic. Do not become discouraged. This optimism need not stem from any false sense of hope; rather, it stems from the very real experiences in our communities. We have more examples than we can name. We see it in our daily lives, in the smallest acts of kindness. We see it in helping our neighbors and helping strangers. We see it every time there is a disaster or a tragedy, when people step up to serve.\n\nFinally and most importantly, thank you. Thank you for caring and continuing to care. Thank you for not giving up. Thank you for pushing forward, not only when it is easy, but particularly when it is (and will continue to be) hard.\n\nStay the course.",

Instead, I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs working based on real experience.\nStrangely for us in the age of\nold school seems to be making a massive comeback\n\nwill continue to be the best city in the World. Prove me Wrong !!\n\nMeetings: Yep, you heard that right. Building communities and asking for referrals is the top way we have been growing. Shaking hands , kissing babies , eating steaks , building trust .\n\nWho knew that\nwas important? My number one prediction? This isn‚Äôt going out of style anytime soon; however, you do need the skill set to do it and since COVID people's competency has dropped off a cliff.\n\n: Believe it or not, cold-calling the right people at the right time with the right message is making a massive impact. Again You need the skills to do it, and it‚Äôs working wonders. use an Agency like\n, or get training from my mateor failing that just do something.\n\n-\n: Make it easy for your customers to purchase. We‚Äôve lost our way with all the sales tactics, sales tech and sales pipeline stages. What used to work and always did was working collaboratively to help buyers purchase.\n\nGive them all the information they need, and when they need it make it easy to find it and progress again dont make things hard for your champion or potential customers to make the deal.\n\nI useteam at's digital sales room to make this happen. Not expensive, easy to use and has a decent impact on deal velocity and close rate. EASY\n\nHere are some stats that back up what I'm saying I've no idea how credible they are or who said them but they agree with me.\n\n-95% of professionals believe that face-to-face meetings are essential for long-term business relationships.\n\n-65% of businesses said that in-person trade shows were an invaluable part of their marketing strategy.\n\n-80% of B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers are expected to occur in digital channels by 20251.\n\n-Digital sales rooms can accelerate deal cycles by up to 50% by providing a centralized space for all sales-related interactions and documents.\n\n49% of buyers prefer that initial contact be made via cold call.\n\n57% of C-level executives and VPs list cold calling as their preferred method of being contacted.\n\nSo, there you have it. No crystal ball, no sympathy posts, no story out of tragedy, no\nlists, no comment to get a free download, and no what's dead.\n\nJust tried and true methods that are delivering results.\n\nLet's have a good one, get out, meet people, sell stuff and save the Economy",
