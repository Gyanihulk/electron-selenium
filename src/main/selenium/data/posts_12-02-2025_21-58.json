Natural language will become the primary interface. Imagine talking to your devices and having them understand and act on your intentions. This is intuitive and transformative.\n\n2. Agents will be personalized and adaptive. They will learn your habits and preferences, becoming more effective over time. This level of personalization is beyond current software.\n\n3. Nadella's prediction affects all software categories. From productivity tools to entertainment, everything will change. This universal applicability is what makes it so disruptive.\n\n4. The focus will shift from operating systems to agent orchestration. Traditional operating systems will become less relevant. New platforms will manage these intelligent agents, creating a new layer of computing infrastructure.\n\n5. Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving this change.\nRapid advancements in AI, particularly LLMs, are enabling the natural language understanding and generation needed for effective agents.\n\nThis change is imminent.\n\nNadella predicts a five to ten-year timeframe for this agent revolution.\nThis is not a distant future concept but a near-term transformation.\n\nAnd make no mistake. Microsoft is disrupting its legacy business model by taking on this journey seriously.\n\n\nHow about you?\n\n️ Share if you believe AI is reshaping enterprise leadership.\n\n Guiding Fortune 500 leaders to unlock AI transformation.

On one hand, current tools like OpenAI’s Operator and Anthropic’s Claude Computer User, while innovative, still seem limited in their capabilities. This makes me think that a full transition is a long way off.\n\nHowever, considering the significant leaps we’ve witnessed in just the past two years—such as the progression from GPT-2 to o1/o3 and the emergence of various other players like DeepSeek, Anthropic, Google, AWS, Microsoft, Apple, and NVIDIA pushing boundaries daily—it’s hard not to believe that this shift could happen sooner than we expect.\n\nFor now, AI agentic processes (not agents) are a reality and they can perform multi-step operations with impressive precision and scalability when given the right instructions and initial input. Yet, human supervision remains crucial. Thoughts?",

If we look at the work we do as the GROSS, and consider the output our NET, then its reasonable to assert that FAILURE is the CO$T we pay to get to the margins that are our WIN$!\n\nIt's okay to fall, in fact it's part of every journey. It is vital that we remind ourselves of this daily. In almost every instance the peaks of success we see in others... Well, they are likely to be built on literal mountains of experimentation and failures that led to the shining summit they enjoy on the other side.\n\nFor GTM, it is a mountain, and acceptable failure is to be expected.

In an attempt to be additive to these cogent words, it seems worth remembering that deep learning LLMs, while reall good at fooling humans that they are human, are not “intelligent”. They are just another advance in information technology that has been advancing, sometimes in steps, sometimes in leaps, for many decades (some would argue centuries). What LLMs, transformers, and their chatty front ends are is quite remarkable, even if not intelligent. They represent a breakthrough in our ability to manage unstructured data, in much the same way that RDMBS, optimizers, and SQL were a breakthrough in our ability to manage structured data.\n\nThe force multiplier here is that there are orders of magnitude more unstructured than structured data in the world.

        "content": "Suspend judgement. Hold back on assumptions. Avoid jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe act of gathering information without immediately assigning a positive or negative connotation can be a tall order. It requires us to check our biases and remain neutral.\n\nSeveral experienced coaches have shared with me a variation of what I’ve come to know as 𝘖𝘣𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘌𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.\n\nThis concept is about centering the client, putting them in the driver’s seat to address their needs while at the same time honoring their wholeness. This is particularly of immense value for marginalized individuals who seek a space that allows them to be raw and vulnerable.\n\nAn integrative approach to coaching means that the full client is able to show up—identity, culture, lived experience, values, behaviors, strengths, areas for growth, and more.\n\nAs I continue practicing this essential coaching method, here are five aspects I keep in mind:\n\n• 𝗥𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲. Observations are factual and based on what can be seen, heard, or measured. As a coach, I must focus on identifying patterns and underlying issues rather than diagnosing a single incident or performance.\n\n• 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆. Providing clear, specific observations helps clients dial in on the exact behaviors or actions being discussed. This clarity can lead to more effective communication, better understanding, and heightened self-awareness.\n\n• 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿. When I as a coach pay greater attention to observations it also models for my clients the need to concentrate on specific behaviors rather than making generalized judgments. With this in mind, clients are more likely to self-generate action steps they can take to achieve their desired outcomes.\n\n• 𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. Another advantage to leading with observations is my ability as a coach to encourage clients to reflect on their own behaviors and come to their own conclusions about what needs to change. This fosters a sense of ownership, and the ability to stand in their personal power.\n\n• 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁. A coaching relationship built on observations fosters trust and openness. Clients are more likely to engage in honest and meaningful discussions about their development when I stay neutral. In turn, I’m able to create a safer and more supportive environment that encourages my clients to explore their behaviors and make improvements without feeling criticized.\n\nDo any of the items shared resonate with you? Is there anything that comes to mind to expand this list?",

        "content": "I hate to break it to you...but 9f you're a solopreneur, you probably don’t have a business.\n\nYou have a job with a really bad boss (yourself).\n\nAnd worse? That boss...\n\n• Doesn’t pay you on time\n• Doesn’t give you benefits\n• Gives you wildly inconsistent pay\n• Expects you to work 60+ hours a week\n\nYou're stuck in the Feast & Famine cycle.\n\n→ One month, you land a big client. Relief.\n→ The next, nothing. Panic. Scramble. Freak out.\n→ You take any work you can find, undercharge, and start over.\n\nYou work harder but never feel safer.\n\nThe problem? You don’t have a real business.\n\nYou have a collection of one-off projects duct-taped together with hope and exhaustion.\n\nIt’s why most solopreneurs eventually quit.\n\nBut there’s another way…\n\nIf you want to break out of this cycle, you need to think like a Solo CEO.\n\n• A premium, easy to sell, offer\n• A repeatable system for landing high-value clients\n• A sales process that works even when you're not working\n\nAnd I know that a lot of you WANT to learn but are scared of investing in a real program.\n\nSo I decided to put my HEART AND SOUL into a 100% free email course, breaking it all down.\n\nStep by step...how to say goodbye to solopreneurship. And hello to Solo CEO.\n\nThe exact process that has helped my clients:\n\n• 7x their rates\n• Close 3 new clients in weeks\n• Go from $500 projects to $20k retainers\n\nIt drops on Friday.\n\nGet ready.\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you're just too antsy, DM me SOLO and I'll make sure you get the link first ",
