Optimize for mobile\n\nDepending on who you ask, the optimal length of a cold outbound sales email is 16-130 words.\n\nRegardless of the source, the consensus is shorter emails get better results.\n\nOne reason is that shorter emails can be read on a mobile device without having to scroll.\n\nIf your prospect can read your CTA without having to scroll you are significantly more likely to get a reply.\n\n\n2. Reduce mental load\n\nShorter emails, especially those that utilize spacing between sentences get higher reply rates.\n\nShort, simple sentences are easier for prospects to scan and quickly absorb.\n\nBy writing short, simple emails with ample spacing, you're making it easier for your prospect to engage with your email.\n\n\n3. Make a point that matters TO THEM\n\nShorter emails force you to get to the point!\n\nWrite straightforward emails that focus on what matters to your prospect (HINT: eliminate as much I, We, Our language as you can) and you'll see an increase in your reply rates within the week.\n\n\n What word or character count do you aim for when writing sales emails?",

Instead, I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs working based on real experience.\nStrangely for us in the age of\nold school seems to be making a massive comeback\n\nwill continue to be the best city in the World. Prove me Wrong !!\n\nMeetings: Yep, you heard that right. Building communities and asking for referrals is the top way we have been growing. Shaking hands , kissing babies , eating steaks , building trust .\n\nWho knew that\nwas important? My number one prediction? This isn‚Äôt going out of style anytime soon; however, you do need the skill set to do it and since COVID people's competency has dropped off a cliff.\n\n: Believe it or not, cold-calling the right people at the right time with the right message is making a massive impact. Again You need the skills to do it, and it‚Äôs working wonders. use an Agency like\n, or get training from my mateor failing that just do something.\n\n-\n: Make it easy for your customers to purchase. We‚Äôve lost our way with all the sales tactics, sales tech and sales pipeline stages. What used to work and always did was working collaboratively to help buyers purchase.\n\nGive them all the information they need, and when they need it make it easy to find it and progress again dont make things hard for your champion or potential customers to make the deal.\n\nI useteam at's digital sales room to make this happen. Not expensive, easy to use and has a decent impact on deal velocity and close rate. EASY\n\nHere are some stats that back up what I'm saying I've no idea how credible they are or who said them but they agree with me.\n\n-95% of professionals believe that face-to-face meetings are essential for long-term business relationships.\n\n-65% of businesses said that in-person trade shows were an invaluable part of their marketing strategy.\n\n-80% of B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers are expected to occur in digital channels by 20251.\n\n-Digital sales rooms can accelerate deal cycles by up to 50% by providing a centralized space for all sales-related interactions and documents.\n\n49% of buyers prefer that initial contact be made via cold call.\n\n57% of C-level executives and VPs list cold calling as their preferred method of being contacted.\n\nSo, there you have it. No crystal ball, no sympathy posts, no story out of tragedy, no\nlists, no comment to get a free download, and no what's dead.\n\nJust tried and true methods that are delivering results.\n\nLet's have a good one, get out, meet people, sell stuff and save the Economy",

It's your superpower. Let it radiate in all you do because with all the copycats out there, the world craves originality now more than ever!\n\n Innovate Fearlessly (Stretch beyond the Box): Break the chains of the conventional and shake up the status quo. Innovation isn't just an idea; it‚Äôs a lifestyle that propels you beyond the ordinary and into the extraordinary!\n\n Forge Genuine Connections (while removing those that pull you down): It's not just about what you know but about who resonates with your journey. Seek out those who will elevate you to new heights and remove those who block your progress either intentionally or unintentionally. Networking isn‚Äôt about exchanging cards and never contacting each other again (neither is connecting on LinkedIn and never speaking to each other by the way); it‚Äôs about sowing seeds for mutual growth and forging solid win-win collaborations!\n\nSo, the question is, are you ready to leave your indelible mark?\n\nDrop your vision in the comments ‚Äì let's inspire each other!",

Let me help‚Ä¶\n\nAI, or artificial intelligence, is a computer‚Äôs ability to mimic human intelligence by doing things like learning patterns, understanding speech, or even creating content.\n\nAI-powered computers contain special processors and algorithms that make them faster and smarter at handling these tasks.\n\nThink of it like this: Traditional PCs rely on you to tell them exactly what to do, step by step. AI PCs, on the other hand, can learn from how you work and make smart decisions by themselves to help you out. For example, they can summarize reports, draft emails, schedule meetings, or even translate conversations during video calls.\n\nFor businesses, AI PCs are changing the game. They can save you time by handling repetitive tasks, boost productivity with personalized workflows, and even increase security by monitoring for unusual behavior and adapting to new threats.\n\nAnd the best part?\n\nWith AI built into the computer itself, sensitive data stays local, improving privacy and security for your business.\n\nDoes the idea of using AI-powered PCs in your business excite you? Or does it seem like too much tech to handle?",

      "content": "I had a wonderful week at the World Economic Forum this week. But except in a few places, the spirit of Davos is fading. \n\nThe Davos week is one I look forward to each year, as it is the moment to reconnect with like-minded people and inspire each other on issues like climate action.\n\nBut this year, while I personally had my best experience ever, leading events on nature and business, climate action, and brain health, my overall assessment is that Davos has become Trump‚Äôs Davos, and that the spirit of Davos is fading.\n\nI say Davos, because I‚Äôve been part of the WEF for long enough to know this isn‚Äôt intentional on behalf of the organization that convenes global business and government leaders here.\n\nAt WEF, the spirit to improve the state of the world remains alive and well.\n\n, the CEO of, told me, for example, that he attended a WEF session with business leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to discuss how business could help reconstruct Ukraine.\n\nHe also went to a meeting of the CEO Climate Alliance, where dozens of CEOs recommitted their companies to Paris aligned climate targets, just as so many US businesses and the new US administration are pulling out.\n\nAnd some side-events remain as trailblazing as ever, bringing stakeholders together on issues from nature to health. That was the Davos bubble I was and am part of, and that energizes me so much.\n\nBut as a journalist, I did venture outside of that bubble too, and what I saw there was sobering. The mainstream of Davos has shifted away from the stakeholder origin of WEF.\n\nI met with dozens of mostly US business leaders who said they were in Davos for one reason, and one reason only: to do business.\n\nLongtime skeptics and critics of Davos will probably shrug at this notion. It‚Äôs what Davos has been known for for many years ‚Äî it‚Äôs a place for the global business elite to meet each other and enrich themselves, they would say.\n\nBut that‚Äôs not how I saw Davos over the years. For attending business leaders, the split was often something like 80-20: 80% business meetings, 20% working on WEF agenda.\n\nNow, however, even that 20% is fast disappearing, at least for US participants. Their political climate is such that stakeholder capitalism, sustainability, and globalism are absolute faux-pas. The business of business is business, once again.\n\nIn some discussions I led, when ideas around global collaboration, nature, or social responsibility were expressed, the general reaction was one of utter disinterest, if not dismissal.\n\nAnd that, I believe, is because the American side of Davos has overnight become Trump‚Äôs Davos. The singular focus of many US business leaders is to increase their profits and mind their own business. Working on a global agenda, or with other stakeholders, is a distraction, and a risk.\n\nI‚Äôm as energized as ever returning from Davos. But the idea that Davos is a place for stakeholderism and globalism, is now minoritarian. The Davos spirit is fading.",

I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the entire E-DAM team for orchestrating such a dynamic and insightful event.\n\nA special thank you to hosts like Bernard Bhutia, T. Bharath, and the entire team who led compelling sessions on the art of debate. Their engaging presentations not only clarified complex concepts but also ignited a passion for critical thinking and effective communication within me. The interactive discussions challenged us to consider diverse perspectives and sharpen our reasoning skills.\n\nI was also fortunate to attend an enlightening session on Web3 and its transformative potential, led by the esteemed expert fondly known as \"Blockchain Sir.\" His deep dive into blockchain technology and the future of decentralized systems opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities that Web3 holds for various industries. Understanding the importance of this next generation of the internet has inspired me to explore its applications further.\n\nEvery concept shared during the event was thoughtfully presented, making even the most complex topics accessible and engaging. The hosts' dedication to education and their willingness to share their expertise made this event stand out as a highlight of my professional journey.\n\nThank you once again to the E-DAM team, Bernard Bhutia, T. Bharath and team and all the phenomenal hosts for their time, effort, and passion. I'm excited to apply the knowledge gained and continue learning about these fascinating subjects. Looking forward to future events and collaborations!",

Those who understand the transformations in the light of the digital economy revolution will find themselves at the forefront of steering the future.\n\nGlobal Economy: Competition Without Boundaries\nBuilding a digital identity with a global dimension has become an indispensable necessity for individuals and organizations seeking leadership. This identity is no longer just a reflection of skills and experiences;it has become a benchmark for measuring an individual's readiness to integrate into global influence networks.\n\nLinkedIn, as a professional digital platform, embodies the passport to this new world.Thanks to its tools that combine professionalism, innovation, and continuous education, it enables users to present themselves with a consistent identity that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries. This digital identity is not just a profile; it is a system that reflects the ability to participate in solving global challenges and building professional networks that open up unlimited horizons.\n\nCreating a digital identity according to global standards requires professionalism, transparency, and continuous skill development. LinkedIn is not just a platform for communication; it is a global laboratory that measures the impact of each individual and their ability to leave a mark on the international stage. In an era where power dynamics are shaped through digitization, the digital identity remains the key that opens doors to opportunities and ensures a place at the forefront of the future.\n\nTowards Global Standards for Digital Identity through Criteria,Transparency, Specialization,Sustainability,Impact\n\nLet us establish an identity that makes a global difference, reflecting our values and positioning us at the forefront of the new human movement.\n\nDr. Charif Noureddine\nIn a world where borders melt, the individual becomes the empire, and their digital presence is their throne.",

      "content": "The Age of AI: Themes from the World Economic Forum Davos 2025\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ The Rise of AI Agents\n\n‚ÄúToday‚Äôs CEOs are the last to manage an all-human workforce.‚Äù The excitement around AI agents was palpable, with OpenAI‚Äôs Operator leading the charge. While these systems remain in a phase of experimentation, the potential is clear‚ÄîAI agents are poised to transform workflows, enhance decision-making, and redefine industries. This isn‚Äôt just a moment of hype; it‚Äôs the dawn of a new operational paradigm.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ US vs. China: The AI Arms Race\n\nChina‚Äôs deployment of millions of super-smart AI agents sparked profound discussions on how AI could reshape power dynamics. ‚ÄúThe power of dictatorships has traditionally been constrained by human limitations. AI removes that constraint.‚Äù\n\nAt the same time, the rise of open-source AI models like DeepSeek R1 is challenging the dominance of proprietary systems. With its impressive performance and low cost, DeepSeek R1 embodies the promise of democratized AI‚Äîbut also raises questions of trust. Can businesses and governments rely on open-source AI for critical operations? This tension highlights the growing geopolitical stakes of AI innovation.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Human Evolution and the Age of FOBO\n\nFOBO‚ÄîFear of Becoming Obsolete‚Äîwas a recurring theme at Davos. ‚ÄúTools are becoming better than humans at almost every task.‚Äù\n\nThe rapid evolution of AI is forcing humanity to rethink not just work but purpose & identity. How do we adapt to a future where AI outpaces human cognitive abilities? Optimists see this as an unparalleled opportunity‚Äîthose who embrace change and prioritize AI literacy will lead in the age of intelligence.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Governance: The Key to Unlocking AI‚Äôs Potential\n\nGovernance was a central focus this year, and for good reason: without it, the full promise of AI cannot be realized. Trust is the foundation of adoption, and governance frameworks are critical to ensuring AI systems like DeepSeek R1‚Äîopen-source yet powerful‚Äîare reliable, secure, and aligned with societal values.\n\nLeaders at Davos recognized that governance is an enabler of innovation.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ AI Investment Amid Uncertainty\n\nDespite economic volatility, AI investment continues to accelerate. The excitement around AI agents, powerful open-source models, and generative capabilities is driving a renewed wave of optimism.\nHowever, overlapping hype cycles demand careful navigation. Investors and businesses must focus on applications that align with governance and trust principles to scale AI responsibly.\n\nThanks to all the AI tools who joined me at Davos - helped take notes, summarize key themes , follow up fast & efficiently on all my to-dos  \n\nDavos 2025 made one thing clear: AI‚Äôs future depends on our ability to evolve alongside it‚Äîresponsibly and with Governance and trust as our foundation. cc",

Output quality isn't there. Pilots stall or stop, even if the use case seems feasible for AI to tackle.\n\nHere‚Äôs the advice I gave a team recently:\n\nOptimize for quality, not scale (at least at first).\n\nHere‚Äôs the approach:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Start with a smaller scope to validate the solution.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Focus on output quality‚Äîensure it works well before expanding.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Once you have clear results, scale gradually.\n\nThis means that you'll need to compromise. Instead of trying to achieve all possible use cases that AI \"could\" achieve. Optimize for a specific use case (i.e. data source or data type), then expand from there.\n\nThe key with AI isn‚Äôt to boil the ocean.\n\nDon‚Äôt assume because ‚Äúit‚Äôs AI,‚Äù it will:\n„ÉªWork through the complexity on its own\n„ÉªUnderstand context without guidance\n„ÉªHandle large and diverse data sets without optimizations\n\nStart small.\nOptimize for quality.\nScale gradually.\n\nÔ∏è Repost.\nFollow for more.",
