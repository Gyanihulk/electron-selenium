This might just become a new Thursday tradition at Swift...\n\nA big thank you tofor stopping by, sharing your expertise, and being a valued friend of the Swift family.

If you do it every day, you're more likely to have healthy teeth and gums.

        "content": "‚ÄºÔ∏è TechBro Shares One Ugly Reality of Profit-driven AI that Led him to Walk Away ‚ÄºÔ∏è\n\nYes, this is one of the many aspects of the tech sector that is not being talked enough about. So here I am sharing one of the reasons I do not want to be part of it anymore.\n\nLuckily, I never found myself in this ugly situation, since I have always been involved in the B2B AI sector.\n\nBut even then, I witnessed firsthand the lack of respect of your privacy amongst companies and investors, pushing ethics and your right at the bottom of the list of priorities.\n\nAt best, ethics is just a box-ticking exercise than a genuine strategy or priority. Look at DEI, for example, and how they messed it up.\n\nIf they truly believed in it, it would‚Äôve been much more than just a brainless and divisive box-ticking exercise.\n\nIf they truly believed in ethics or diversity, they wouldn‚Äôt have capitulated to the ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù nonsense or behave like beta-men kissing the ring of some man-child overcompensating for something.\n\nI know for a fact that many of my ex-investors would‚Äôve pushed me to join the current AI race to get the cash and attention regardless of consequences. But this is not the reason I dedicated my entire adult life to AI innovation since the latest 90s.\n\nAI models are remarkable and extremely powerful tool to achieve some great business outcomes, as well as major social benefits.\n\nAnd, no, they do not require giving away your privacy rights or copyrights, etc.\n\nBelieve me, you can do a hell of a lot more than using the multi-billion dollar models to summarise documents, ask for recipes, or ask it to automate some random tasks.\n\nAI can literally change the world. One example that I like to use is DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaFold ‚Äî a smaller AI model that has revolutionised biotech forever. Yet, where is their spotlight and cash?\n\nWhat I am sharing here is a one reality of tech that does not prioritise people, and certainly does not prioritise innovation. It‚Äôs cash, cash and more cash ‚Äî with loads of data on top (have you seen DOGE recently )\n\nStill have doubts? Well, check the link on the comments of what OpenAI and Microsoft really mean by ‚ÄúAGI‚Äù ‚Äî you know, the super AI intelligence that apparently you need in your life (spoiler alert you don‚Äôt need it and it has nothing to do with intelligence).\n\nJust a thought for you this weekend. Happy Friday Ô∏è",

        "content": "10 Leadership Lessons from Claudia Infante, Margaritaville CDO‚Äîrecent recipient of Hospitality Technology‚Äôs 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award \n\nUnder her leadership, Margaritaville launched its perks loyalty program which attracted 350,000 members in less than two years! \n\nIt generated more than $150M in revenue!\n\nI had the privilege of sitting down with Claudia to explore Margaritaville‚Äôs tech stack in depth. Here are 10 leadership lessons I learned from her‚Äîand why I wholeheartedly agree with each one:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúTechnology should complement and optimize the human experience, not replace it.‚Äù\n\nYes. The right tech eliminates friction and empowers teams to focus on what truly matters: creating personal, memorable stays.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúBe adaptable and nimble in response to change.‚Äù\n\nThe most successful operators test, iterate, and pivot quickly‚Äîwhether responding to evolving guest preferences or adopting new technologies.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúCultivate a passionate and adaptable workforce.‚Äù\n\nTeams that love what they do and can navigate new challenges deliver exceptional service, no matter the circumstances.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúDevelop a unique loyalty program that aligns with your brand identity.‚Äù\n\nEmotional loyalty‚Äîbuilt through surprise perks and personalized experiences‚Äîfosters stronger guest connections than points ever could.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúChoose technology partners that align with your brand values and growth strategy.‚Äù\n\nThe best ones collaborate with you to solve problems, share your vision, and innovate alongside your team.\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúRegularly evaluate your technology stack and make adjustments as needed.‚Äù\n\nWhat worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. Regular reviews ensure your systems align with operational goals and keep pace with evolving guest needs.\n\n7Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúStrive for a balanced tech stack that caters to your specific needs.‚Äù\n\nOne size doesn‚Äôt fit all. Combine mandated systems with open solutions to keep operations efficient, flexible, and scalable.\n\n8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúLeverage data visualization to gain insights and make informed decisions.‚Äù\n\nData isn‚Äôt useful if you can‚Äôt act on it. Real-time dashboards highlight trends and opportunities, helping teams make smarter, faster decisions.\n\n9Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúEmbrace AI strategically to enhance the guest experience and streamline operations.‚Äù\n\nAI should enhance human interaction rather than replace it. Whether through predictive analytics or chatbots, the goal is to create seamless and personalized guest journeys.\n\n ‚ÄúEmpower your team with the right tools and training to focus on guest experience.‚Äù\n\nAutomation reduces the mundane, freeing your team to focus on what guests value most: genuine care and thoughtful service.\n\nClaudia‚Äôs visionary leadership and commitment to innovation truly set a standard for excellence in hospitality. \n.\n.\nFollow our podcast for more strategies from the top names in hospitality:\n",

The deep fulfillment of coaching.\n\nNothing quite matches the satisfaction of seeing your guidance take root and flourish. Not just in closing a specific deal, but in shaping someone's entire career trajectory.\n\nLast month, a rep I coached over a decade ago reached out. They shared how certain principles we discussed years ago are still cornerstone elements of their sales approach today. These moments - when you realize your impact extends far beyond quarterly numbers - are truly priceless.\n\nThis reinforced something I've always believed: The ROI of coaching isn't measured in immediate wins, but in the compound effect of transformed careers.\n\nStarting next week, I'm doubling down on coaching conversations. Because sometimes the most valuable deals we close aren't measured in dollars, but in the lasting impact we have on others.",

They run two sets of guides. One pair takes the clients with the cat and the other pair goes around scouting conditions and initiating slides.\n\nOn other trips we've skied this bowl, but obviously not today. By releasing it, we could safely skier the rim and do a less steep run that was off to my left. Then the runout through the trees doesn't have all that snow hanging above you.\n\nIf they hadn't been able to get the whole thing to go, we would've stayed on other terrain.\n\nI know a fair amount about reading avalanche conditions, including enough to know I'd never have been out there with this week's pack without the real pros and their mitigations to keep us safe.",

It‚Äôs full of moments where you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôre on the verge of something great or completely off track.\n\nBut the magic isn‚Äôt in avoiding the struggle‚Äîit‚Äôs in what it teaches us.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned about this space in between:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ The ‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù Moments\n\nThose near-misses? They‚Äôre not failures‚Äîthey‚Äôre feedback. When I was building my first tech company, every ‚Äúalmost‚Äù showed us what our clients actually needed, not just what we thought they wanted.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ The Beautiful Mess\n\nThis is where real growth happens. I call it ‚Äúproductive discomfort‚Äù‚Äîthose moments when you‚Äôre questioning everything. But that‚Äôs exactly where the breakthroughs hide.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ The Pause\n\nWe‚Äôre told to hustle from failure to success, but there‚Äôs power in the pause. Sitting with what didn‚Äôt work, letting it teach you‚Äîsometimes the biggest leaps forward start by stepping back.\n\nWhy This Space Matters:\n1. It‚Äôs where innovation is born.\n2. It‚Äôs where resilience is built.\n3. It‚Äôs where your weird becomes your superpower.\n\nSuccess isn‚Äôt about skipping the messy middle‚Äîit‚Äôs about learning to navigate it.\n\nWhat‚Äôs been your experience in this space between failure and success? I‚Äôd love to hear your stories.",

I realized, I was neglecting my profile views.\n\n\nHere‚Äôs what I learned:\n\n Profile Views are Your Digital Footprint.\n\n‚Üí Every time someone views your profile, it‚Äôs an opportunity.\n‚Üí Profile views are a signal that someone is interested in you. That‚Äôs the first step toward making a meaningful connection.\n\n Your Profile is Your First Impression.\n\n‚Üí When someone clicks on your profile, that‚Äôs their first opportunity to learn about you.\n‚Üí If your profile isn‚Äôt optimized, you‚Äôre losing a chance to build trust and show what you‚Äôre about.\n\n How to Get More Profile Views:\n\n‚Üí Optimize your headline and summary. Make it clear, concise, and compelling.\n‚Üí Post regularly and engage actively with others. Be visible.\n‚Üí Use keywords that attract your ideal audience.\n\n Don‚Äôt Just Wait for Views, Encourage Them.\n\n‚Üí When you engage in meaningful conversations, people are more likely to check out your profile.\n‚Üí Every interaction is a chance for a new view.\n\n Take Action When You Get Views.\n\n‚Üí When you see someone has viewed your profile, take the opportunity to send them a personalized message.\n‚Üí Don‚Äôt just wait for them to connect with you, be proactive.\n\n\nI used to neglect my profile views, but once I started focusing on them, the results came.\n\nMy profile views increased, and so did my connections. More importantly, the quality of my connections grew.\n\n\nStop neglecting them. Start using them to your advantage.\n\n\n\nIf you found it helpful Ô∏è & connect",

You‚Äôre better off trying to run a marathon with two left shoes. \n\nOne of our recent clients - a leading real estate and home services company - struggled with fragmented ERP systems and manual processes. Their digital financial and operation management was inefficient and time-consuming.\n\nTo help them out, we implemented Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management. These platforms centralized their operations and streamlined workflows. We created a tailored solution to enable faster, data-driven decision-making by integrating real-time data with Power BI and connecting their CRM systems.\n\nWe were aiming for efficiency, but we ended up with a client whose operations sped up like an F1 racecar with fresh tires. They can now process financials in record time and harness real-time insights to fine-tune their supply chain performance on the fly.\n\nYour digital tools should be driving you forward, not slowing you down.

His journey from witnessing the harsh realities of street life to creating impactful solutions is one you won‚Äôt want to miss.\n\nKal's story isn't just about law enforcement; it's about understanding the root causes of crime and creating real, lasting change.\n\nKal shares his experiences in one of North America's most challenging environments, describing the complex socio-economic factors that contribute to the open-air drug market and the cycle of violence. He talks about the \"perfect storm\" of social housing, mental health challenges, and organized crime that plagues the Downtown Eastside. But more importantly, he shares the pivotal moment that shifted his focus from reactive policing to proactive community building.\n\nThis realization led Kal to found the KidsPlay Foundation, a registered charity dedicated to providing youth with positive alternatives. He explains the six streams of KidsPlay's work ‚Äì education, sports, mentorship, environment, clinical counseling, and community patrol ‚Äì and shares inspiring stories of kids whose lives have been transformed. From educational field trips to sports programs and mentorship opportunities, KidsPlay offers a lifeline to vulnerable youth, helping them develop valuable skills and make positive choices. Kal's powerful \"mahout\" metaphor perfectly illustrates the importance of instilling positive values early in life.\n\nJoin me, Thomas Scaria, ultra-marathoner and resilience coach, as I talk with Kal about his incredible journey, the challenges facing inner-city youth, and the transformative power of hope and opportunity. This is a conversation that will leave you inspired and motivated to make a difference.\n\nTune in to the Resilience+Rise podcast now! (Full Podcast & connection in the comments)",

        "content": "The 12-Month Mirage: Why Your Data Supplier's \"Verification\" Calls Are Costing You Sales\n\nMany businesses rely on data suppliers who promise \"verified\" business information, often claiming to call each business to confirm details. But what if this \"verification\" happens only once a year, or even less frequently or even done where all the information was asked to whoever happened to answer the phone at that moment?\n\nWe recently encountered a client facing this very issue. Their data provider assured them of regularly updated and accurate contact information, based on these periodic calls. However, their sales team was struggling, encountering a frustratingly high number of outdated contacts. They were chasing businesses that had closed, contacts who had moved on, and generally wasting valuable time and resources.\n\nOur team conducted a complimentary data audit, uncovering a significant disconnect between the promised verification and the reality on the ground. Over 23% of the records represented businesses that were no longer operating. The accuracy of the remaining contacts, supposedly \"verified\" within the past year, hovered around a disappointing 80%. This highlighted a critical flaw: a single phone call, conducted perhaps once a year, is simply insufficient to maintain data accuracy in today's rapidly changing business environment. Businesses close, people move jobs, and information becomes outdated quickly. A snapshot taken once a year is hardly a reliable reflection of the current landscape.\n\nThis situation echoes our experiences when we acquiredwho in addition to their own fleet data re-sold a 3rd parties own tele-verified data. It reinforces a crucial point: data accuracy is not a one-time event; it's an ongoing process.\n\nWe helped our client address these data challenges by thoroughly cleansing their database, removing dissolved businesses and verifying the remaining contacts through more robust and frequent methods using our own technology which updates our entire database every 30 days using our machine led process. The impact was immediate and positive. Their sales team, now equipped with accurate, up-to-date data, experienced a substantial increase in productivity and lead conversion.\n\nThis experience exposes the myth of the annual \"verification\" call. It's not just inefficient; it's misleading. Relying on such infrequent checks creates a false sense of security, leading businesses to believe they have accurate data when they‚Äôre working with outdated and unreliable information.\n\nWe understand that data accuracy requires continuous effort. Our 30-day, machine-led process provides ongoing data refinement, ensuring that our clients always have access to the most up-to-date and accurate information. We empower businesses to move beyond the limitations of outdated verification practices and embrace data-driven strategies that deliver real results.",
