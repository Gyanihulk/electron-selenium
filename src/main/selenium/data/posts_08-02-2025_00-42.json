Before he came, he joked, “Mayer, you know, prepare a Coke.”\n\n\nAt, we believe in doing things differently—so we didn’t just bring the Coke, we turned it into a Chulent gathering, filled with great conversations and valuable insights.\n\n\nWhat started as a casual visit quickly became an engaging exchange of ideas, reminding us that the best discussions happen in the right environment—one that fosters connection, collaboration, and innovation.\n\nWho knows? This might just become a new Thursday tradition at Swift...\n\nA big thank you tofor stopping by, sharing your expertise, and being a valued friend of the Swift family. Looking forward to many more inspiring conversations ahead iyh.",

It’s a high-load simulation designed to test onchain performance.\n\nEach “game” involves intensive calculations—tracking ball physics, collisions, and game logic—all processed onchain.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\n- Ethereum struggles with latency and heavy computations due to its gas limits.\n- Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum improve scalability but inherit EVM performance limits and come with fragmentation.\n\nOn the other hand...\n\nGear.exe is an Ethereum network extension that executes multiple simulations in a single block with near-zero gas fees and comes without fragmentation.\n\nThe Setup:\n\nWe tested the same simulation on:\n- Ethereum: Baseline test to measure performance and costs.\n- Arbitrum EVM: Cheaper, but same gas logic as Ethereum.\n- Arbitrum Nitro: Optimized with WASM, 1,000 iterations per block.\n- Gear.exe: Parallel execution of 16 games in a single Ethereum block.\n\nWhy Gear.exe stands out:\n\n- Runs 16 high-load simulations simultaneously in a single block.\n- Near-zero gas costs and and low latency for massive computations.\n- Drastically improved UX: avoids fragmentation and latency on user a side.\n- Fully compatible with Ethereum (MetaMask, Etherscan).\n- Network extension - value accrual on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nImagine the possibilities:\n\nThis simulation demonstrates that Gear.exe isn’t just for gaming—it’s a game-changer for any high-load computation on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n• DeFi protocols? Check.\n• Machine learning models? Check.\n• Real-time gaming? Check.\n\nAnd we kept the receipts to prove it:",

But what if they could \"feel\" time in real-time—discreetly and effortlessly?\n\nInstead of traditional watch hands or screens, the Dot Watch features a dynamic Braille display with four active cells that refresh seamlessly, allowing users to read the time, notifications, and even texts through touch.\n\n Beyond Timekeeping:\n\nReads messages, alarms, and notifications via Bluetooth\nOffers tactile navigation for daily tasks\nLightweight, sleek, and stylish—no more clunky accessibility devices\n\n Technology should empower, not exclude.

This reduces guesswork, speeds up repairs, and improves first-time fix rates.\n\n2) Voice-enabled workflows are streamlining operations: Hands-free interactions allow technicians to log updates, receive step-by-step instructions, and access safety checklists—all without stopping work.\n\n3) Automation is eliminating inefficiencies: AI is optimizing scheduling, rerouting technicians in real time, and keeping customers informed without manual effort.\n\nAs AI capabilities expand, field service is becoming faster, more precise, and more efficient.\n\nThis is just the beginning of what’s possible.",

I make myself a \"floating head\" when I share my screen.\n\nCheck out the image in the post to see how.\n\nNot sure why but EVERYONE comments on it.\n\nIt's just me in the corner of the screen with what I'm presenting.\n\n\n2. I use captions when I can't understand someone.\n\nIt might be an accent, bad audio, etc.\n\nBut the real time captions help me actually be able to \"listen\" to someone.\n\nLiterally saved my life in a recent meeting with some French folks.\n\n\n️ Consider reposting if you wanna share some Zoom tips.\n\n Do you have a favorite Zoom trick?",

Breathtaking views.\nBut also—an eye-opener.\n\nHere’s the story:\n\nI had a competent guide.\n\nShe knew the route, the weather patterns, and the dangers.\n\nThe catch? She didn’t speak English.\n\nSo, I missed the little things:\n\n→ \"Add a jacket before the ridge - brutal wind ahead.\"\n→ “Eat now - next break is hours away.”\n→ Even a simple “You’re doing great!”\n\nIt made the climb harder than it needed to be.\n\nMeanwhile, there was another climber on the route.\n\nA complete rookie. Brand new gear. Underprepared.\n\nAnd guess what? She also summited.\n\nWhy?\n\nHer guide was incredible.\n\n- Cheering her on.\n- Giving her all the tips.\n- Keeping her at peak performance.\n\nShe wasn’t just climbing a mountain, she was being 𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘦𝘥.\n\nThat hit me hard. Mentorship matters.\n\nIt makes hard things easier, faster, and more achievable.\n\nAnd not just when you're climbing mountains.\n\nIt goes for your career. Your mindset. Your life.\n\nIf you feel like you’re climbing without the guidance you need, it’s time to change that.\n\nYou don’t have to struggle harder than you need to.\n\nYou just need a better guide.\n\nP.S. Do you prefer having mentors, or do you learn best on your own?",

        "content": "‼️ TechBro Shares One Ugly Reality of Profit-driven AI that Led him to Walk Away ‼️\n\nYes, this is one of the many aspects of the tech sector that is not being talked enough about. So here I am sharing one of the reasons I do not want to be part of it anymore.\n\nLuckily, I never found myself in this ugly situation, since I have always been involved in the B2B AI sector.\n\nBut even then, I witnessed firsthand the lack of respect of your privacy amongst companies and investors, pushing ethics and your right at the bottom of the list of priorities.\n\nAt best, ethics is just a box-ticking exercise than a genuine strategy or priority. Look at DEI, for example, and how they messed it up.\n\nIf they truly believed in it, it would’ve been much more than just a brainless and divisive box-ticking exercise.\n\nIf they truly believed in ethics or diversity, they wouldn’t have capitulated to the “masculinity” nonsense or behave like beta-men kissing the ring of some man-child overcompensating for something.\n\nI know for a fact that many of my ex-investors would’ve pushed me to join the current AI race to get the cash and attention regardless of consequences. But this is not the reason I dedicated my entire adult life to AI innovation since the latest 90s.\n\nAI models are remarkable and extremely powerful tool to achieve some great business outcomes, as well as major social benefits.\n\nAnd, no, they do not require giving away your privacy rights or copyrights, etc.\n\nBelieve me, you can do a hell of a lot more than using the multi-billion dollar models to summarise documents, ask for recipes, or ask it to automate some random tasks.\n\nAI can literally change the world. One example that I like to use is DeepMind’s AlphaFold — a smaller AI model that has revolutionised biotech forever. Yet, where is their spotlight and cash?\n\nWhat I am sharing here is a one reality of tech that does not prioritise people, and certainly does not prioritise innovation. It’s cash, cash and more cash — with loads of data on top (have you seen DOGE recently )\n\nStill have doubts? Well, check the link on the comments of what OpenAI and Microsoft really mean by “AGI” — you know, the super AI intelligence that apparently you need in your life (spoiler alert you don’t need it and it has nothing to do with intelligence).\n\nJust a thought for you this weekend.

You pay a price for it – sometimes in your mental peace, personal space, or lifestyle choices.\n\nBut the trade-offs? They’re worth it:\n\n↗ My mom still ensures I eat properly (and yes, she brings me fruits while I work).\n↗ I don’t have to think about laundry or changing bedsheets or whether there’s tea when I need it – everything just happens.\n↗ I save a lot on rent in a city like Mumbai, and I spend/invest that money where it actually matters without any guilt.\n↗ Even travel expenses are significantly lower—another bonus most people don’t talk about.\n\nI’m building my career, growing my online community of 700k+, and scaling my content business—all while being supported by the very people who raised me.\n\nIsn’t that a kind of privilege too?\nIndependence doesn’t have one definition.\nFor me, choosing to stay is its own kind of freedom.\n\nLiving with family might not be for everyone or every profession.\nBut the way the world glorifies moving out, rarely do we talk about what we gain when we choose to stay.\n\nI guess we need to stop attaching our self-worth to the idea of moving out.\n\nDo you think living with family holds you back or provides the support you need to grow?",

        "content": "10 Leadership Lessons from Claudia Infante, Margaritaville CDO—recent recipient of Hospitality Technology’s 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award \n\nUnder her leadership, Margaritaville launched its perks loyalty program which attracted 350,000 members in less than two years! \n\nIt generated more than $150M in revenue!\n\nI had the privilege of sitting down with Claudia to explore Margaritaville’s tech stack in depth. Here are 10 leadership lessons I learned from her—and why I wholeheartedly agree with each one:\n\n1️⃣ “Technology should complement and optimize the human experience, not replace it.”\n\nYes. The right tech eliminates friction and empowers teams to focus on what truly matters: creating personal, memorable stays.\n\n2️⃣ “Be adaptable and nimble in response to change.”\n\nThe most successful operators test, iterate, and pivot quickly—whether responding to evolving guest preferences or adopting new technologies.\n\n3️⃣ “Cultivate a passionate and adaptable workforce.”\n\nTeams that love what they do and can navigate new challenges deliver exceptional service, no matter the circumstances.\n\n4️⃣ “Develop a unique loyalty program that aligns with your brand identity.”\n\nEmotional loyalty—built through surprise perks and personalized experiences—fosters stronger guest connections than points ever could.\n\n5️⃣ “Choose technology partners that align with your brand values and growth strategy.”\n\nThe best ones collaborate with you to solve problems, share your vision, and innovate alongside your team.\n\n6️⃣ “Regularly evaluate your technology stack and make adjustments as needed.”\n\nWhat worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. Regular reviews ensure your systems align with operational goals and keep pace with evolving guest needs.\n\n7️⃣ “Strive for a balanced tech stack that caters to your specific needs.”\n\nOne size doesn’t fit all. Combine mandated systems with open solutions to keep operations efficient, flexible, and scalable.\n\n8️⃣ “Leverage data visualization to gain insights and make informed decisions.”\n\nData isn’t useful if you can’t act on it. Real-time dashboards highlight trends and opportunities, helping teams make smarter, faster decisions.\n\n9️⃣ “Embrace AI strategically to enhance the guest experience and streamline operations.”\n\nAI should enhance human interaction rather than replace it. Whether through predictive analytics or chatbots, the goal is to create seamless and personalized guest journeys.\n\n “Empower your team with the right tools and training to focus on guest experience.”\n\nAutomation reduces the mundane, freeing your team to focus on what guests value most: genuine care and thoughtful service.\n\nClaudia’s visionary leadership and commitment to innovation truly set a standard for excellence in hospitality. \n.\n.\nFollow our podcast for more strategies from the top names in hospitality:\n",

        "content": "A rep recently asked me why I chose the path of Sales VP over being an individual contributor. \"The stress is higher, and you could probably make more as a top performer,\" he said.\n\nMy answer? The deep fulfillment of coaching.\n\nNothing quite matches the satisfaction of seeing your guidance take root and flourish. Not just in closing a specific deal, but in shaping someone's entire career trajectory.\n\nLast month, a rep I coached over a decade ago reached out. They shared how certain principles we discussed years ago are still cornerstone elements of their sales approach today. These moments - when you realize your impact extends far beyond quarterly numbers - are truly priceless.\n\nThis reinforced something I've always believed: The ROI of coaching isn't measured in immediate wins, but in the compound effect of transformed careers.\n\nStarting next week, I'm doubling down on coaching conversations. Because sometimes the most valuable deals we close aren't measured in dollars, but in the lasting impact we have on others.",

They run two sets of guides. One pair takes the clients with the cat and the other pair goes around scouting conditions and initiating slides.\n\nOn other trips we've skied this bowl, but obviously not today. By releasing it, we could safely skier the rim and do a less steep run that was off to my left. Then the runout through the trees doesn't have all that snow hanging above you.\n\nIf they hadn't been able to get the whole thing to go, we would've stayed on other terrain.\n\nI know a fair amount about reading avalanche conditions, including enough to know I'd never have been out there with this week's pack without the real pros and their mitigations to keep us safe.",

None of us would react that way.\n\nWe’d be annoyed. Ignored. Frustrated. And we’d remember exactly why salespeople have a bad reputation with buyers. You’d be hanging up with fury and would likely block their number.\n\n‘Sales people don’t listen’.\n\nThe tale as old as time.\n\nYet, I recently saw a Sales Trainer on here suggest this is exactly what reps should do—backed by a chorus of commenters cheering it on.\n\nIf this is what’s being taught, is it any wonder so many reps struggle to build pipeline?\n\nUntil we start putting ourselves in our prospect’s shoes, we’ll keep failing to build trust and credibility with buyers.",

It’s full of moments where you’re not sure if you’re on the verge of something great or completely off track.\n\nBut the magic isn’t in avoiding the struggle—it’s in what it teaches us.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned about this space in between:\n\n1️⃣ The “Almost” Moments\n\nThose near-misses? They’re not failures—they’re feedback. When I was building my first tech company, every “almost” showed us what our clients actually needed, not just what we thought they wanted.\n\n2️⃣ The Beautiful Mess\n\nThis is where real growth happens. I call it “productive discomfort”—those moments when you’re questioning everything. But that’s exactly where the breakthroughs hide.\n\n3️⃣ The Pause\n\nWe’re told to hustle from failure to success, but there’s power in the pause. Sitting with what didn’t work, letting it teach you—sometimes the biggest leaps forward start by stepping back.\n\nWhy This Space Matters:\n1. It’s where innovation is born.\n2. It’s where resilience is built.\n3. It’s where your weird becomes your superpower.\n\nSuccess isn’t about skipping the messy middle—it’s about learning to navigate it.\n\nWhat’s been your experience in this space between failure and success? I’d love to hear your stories.",

I was posting regularly, connecting with people, and building my network. \n\nBut despite all the activity, something felt off.\n\nI wasn't seeing the results I expected.\n\nI would see my post engagements, but then... nothing.\n\nMy profile views were low, and my connection requests were stagnant. I realized, I was neglecting my profile views.\n\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\n Profile Views are Your Digital Footprint.\n\n→ Every time someone views your profile, it’s an opportunity.\n→ Profile views are a signal that someone is interested in you. That’s the first step toward making a meaningful connection.\n\n Your Profile is Your First Impression.\n\n→ When someone clicks on your profile, that’s their first opportunity to learn about you.\n→ If your profile isn’t optimized, you’re losing a chance to build trust and show what you’re about.\n\n How to Get More Profile Views:\n\n→ Optimize your headline and summary. Make it clear, concise, and compelling.\n→ Post regularly and engage actively with others. Be visible.\n→ Use keywords that attract your ideal audience.\n\n Don’t Just Wait for Views, Encourage Them.\n\n→ When you engage in meaningful conversations, people are more likely to check out your profile.\n→ Every interaction is a chance for a new view.\n\n Take Action When You Get Views.\n\n→ When you see someone has viewed your profile, take the opportunity to send them a personalized message.\n→ Don’t just wait for them to connect with you, be proactive.\n\n\nI used to neglect my profile views, but once I started focusing on them, the results came.\n\nMy profile views increased, and so did my connections. More importantly, the quality of my connections grew.\n\n\nStop neglecting them. Start using them to your advantage.\n\n\n\nIf you found it helpful ️ & connect",

You’re better off trying to run a marathon with two left shoes. \n\nOne of our recent clients - a leading real estate and home services company - struggled with fragmented ERP systems and manual processes. Their digital financial and operation management was inefficient and time-consuming.\n\nTo help them out, we implemented Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management.

His journey from witnessing the harsh realities of street life to creating impactful solutions is one you won’t want to miss.\n\nKal's story isn't just about law enforcement; it's about understanding the root causes of crime and creating real, lasting change.\n\nKal shares his experiences in one of North America's most challenging environments, describing the complex socio-economic factors that contribute to the open-air drug market and the cycle of violence. He talks about the \"perfect storm\" of social housing, mental health challenges, and organized crime that plagues the Downtown Eastside. But more importantly, he shares the pivotal moment that shifted his focus from reactive policing to proactive community building.\n\nThis realization led Kal to found the KidsPlay Foundation, a registered charity dedicated to providing youth with positive alternatives. He explains the six streams of KidsPlay's work – education, sports, mentorship, environment, clinical counseling, and community patrol – and shares inspiring stories of kids whose lives have been transformed. From educational field trips to sports programs and mentorship opportunities, KidsPlay offers a lifeline to vulnerable youth, helping them develop valuable skills and make positive choices. Kal's powerful \"mahout\" metaphor perfectly illustrates the importance of instilling positive values early in life.\n\nJoin me, Thomas Scaria, ultra-marathoner and resilience coach, as I talk with Kal about his incredible journey, the challenges facing inner-city youth, and the transformative power of hope and opportunity. This is a conversation that will leave you inspired and motivated to make a difference.\n\nTune in to the Resilience+Rise podcast now! (Full Podcast & connection in the comments)",

        "content": "The 12-Month Mirage: Why Your Data Supplier's \"Verification\" Calls Are Costing You Sales\n\nMany businesses rely on data suppliers who promise \"verified\" business information, often claiming to call each business to confirm details. But what if this \"verification\" happens only once a year, or even less frequently or even done where all the information was asked to whoever happened to answer the phone at that moment?\n\nWe recently encountered a client facing this very issue. Their data provider assured them of regularly updated and accurate contact information, based on these periodic calls. However, their sales team was struggling, encountering a frustratingly high number of outdated contacts. They were chasing businesses that had closed, contacts who had moved on, and generally wasting valuable time and resources.\n\nOur team conducted a complimentary data audit, uncovering a significant disconnect between the promised verification and the reality on the ground. Over 23% of the records represented businesses that were no longer operating. The accuracy of the remaining contacts, supposedly \"verified\" within the past year, hovered around a disappointing 80%. This highlighted a critical flaw: a single phone call, conducted perhaps once a year, is simply insufficient to maintain data accuracy in today's rapidly changing business environment. Businesses close, people move jobs, and information becomes outdated quickly. A snapshot taken once a year is hardly a reliable reflection of the current landscape.\n\nThis situation echoes our experiences when we acquiredwho in addition to their own fleet data re-sold a 3rd parties own tele-verified data. It reinforces a crucial point: data accuracy is not a one-time event; it's an ongoing process.\n\nWe helped our client address these data challenges by thoroughly cleansing their database, removing dissolved businesses and verifying the remaining contacts through more robust and frequent methods using our own technology which updates our entire database every 30 days using our machine led process. The impact was immediate and positive. Their sales team, now equipped with accurate, up-to-date data, experienced a substantial increase in productivity and lead conversion.\n\nThis experience exposes the myth of the annual \"verification\" call. It's not just inefficient; it's misleading. Relying on such infrequent checks creates a false sense of security, leading businesses to believe they have accurate data when they’re working with outdated and unreliable information.\n\nWe understand that data accuracy requires continuous effort. Our 30-day, machine-led process provides ongoing data refinement, ensuring that our clients always have access to the most up-to-date and accurate information. We empower businesses to move beyond the limitations of outdated verification practices and embrace data-driven strategies that deliver real results.",
