            "commentText": " BONUS: 5 WAYS TO DEFEND YOUR TEAM WITHOUT LOWERING THE BAR \n\n1. Own mistakes publicly, correct them privately. If something goes wrong, take responsibility as a leader. But behind closed doors, help your team learn and improve without fear or shame.\n\n2. Redirect blame, but share credit generously. When pressure comes from above, protect your team from unnecessary heat. But when wins happen, make sure their contributions; not just yours are recognized.\n\n3. Push for fair workloads, not just fast results. Defending your team means speaking up when deadlines are unrealistic or workloads are unsustainable. Burnout isn‚Äôt a badge of honor; balance leads to better performance.\n\n4. Call out toxic behavior, even when it's uncomfortable. Gossip, undercutting, or back channeling can destroy trust fast. Set the tone by addressing it directly, even when it comes from higher-ups.\n\n5. Be the leader they trust in tough moments. Anyone can be supportive when things go well. True leadership shows when stakes are high; stay calm, stand by your team, and problem-solve together.",

I‚Äôm sure opinions land on both sides of the debate.\n\nGeorgia state house is entertaining the idea that athletes\nearning would be exempt from state income taxes.\n\nThe theory behind the push makes sense on its face: if other states are doing this, Georgia universities would be at a recruiting disadvantage. Furthermore, many NIL deals for athletes do not reach the scale of the\namounts that hit the headlines.\n\nThe counter-argument, however is that it makes a distinction between the same type of income- namely income from being an\n, solely based on a criteria unrelated to the income itself. If you‚Äôre a student on an academic scholarship and get paid to post you have to pay state income taxes. Your best friend on the basketball team doesn‚Äôt. Could be the exact same post.\n\nAnd what about those influencers that aren‚Äôt in college? What about other workers in the state that couldnt afford to go to college? Why are their earnings paying to subsidize others?\n\nLots to unpack here.",

        "content": " For those embarking on developing AI agents, sharing a few lessons learned from our journey of developing vertical AI agents for GTM. \n\nBuilding these agents for developing GTM strategy and execution taught us that success starts with a clear breakdown of every task that we wanted the agent to perform and, more importantly, providing the right context for each.\n\n**The foundation: A Solid Framework**\n\nFirst we needed to build a robust framework. We began by designing a framework that not only outlines the different tasks for the agent, but also embeds the specific conditions needed for each one to execute effectively. The framework builds on best practices for GTM and also defines clear outcomes.\n\n **The Best Teacher? Testing.**\n\nBy running our agents through diverse scenarios‚Äîfrom building GTM strategies for different company sizes to various business types‚Äîwe uncovered gaps in our framework, issues with context delivery, and opportunities for better end user experience.\n\nThis testing process reinforced one key lesson: Crafting production-quality, reliable agents that can truly boost human productivity demands deep, iterative work.\n\nÔ∏è The payoff?\nThe hard work pays off with smarter, more adaptable product that can genuinely support strategic decision-making.\n\nHowever, the journey doesn't end after launch.\n\nSupporting technology, like GenAI models are evolving everyday - with upgrades to APIs and newer models being released that require testing, enhancements and updates to all functional scenarios.\n\nBut the rewards in improved efficiency and effectiveness are mind blowing and well worth it.\n\n Takeaway:\n\nAgent-driven software is the future‚Äîjust don't underestimate the work it takes to build products that people can rely on.\n\nUpdating AI agents with evolution of the underlying technology as well as evolution of business process they support will require deep, ongoing effort.\n\nStay adaptable. Keep iterating. The rewards in efficiency and impact are worth it.\n\n**DM if you'd like to see what we've done and trade notes.**",

She says, \"Instead of telling young people, \"Get a mentor and you will excel,\" we tell them \"Excel, and you will get a mentor.\" I feel like the same principle applies to referrals. Do excellent work and the referrals will follow. The timing of the ask is less important than the deep-down knowledge that the response will be \"of course!\"",

Watching this group bring their A-game‚Äîwhether at work or on the bowling lane‚Äîreminds me of how much CompQsoft has grown. I started my journey in tech as an independent consultant, and to now be leading this incredible group of professionals is nothing short of humbling.\n\nWe‚Äôve had so many wins in 2024, delivering exceptional IT solutions to U.S. federal agencies, and tonight was all about celebrating those victories together. We've started out 2025 strong, and I have no doubt that the SUBMEPP team will keep this momentum going.",

Here is the good AND the bad from the call.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. Got him to visit the website.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects aboutis that you can live video call prospects on your website. The fact that I was able to show him this on the initial cold call, is a perfect way to build intrigue to ensure that he actually shows up to the meeting.\n\n2. Calm and collected tone.\n\nI think this call was a good example of how important it is to have a calm and collected tone to disarm prospects and show them you‚Äôre a real HUMAN - not some sleazy telemarketer.\n\n3. ASKED for the meeting when I knew he was interested.\n\nSo often reps will wait TOO long to ask for the meeting - even when the prospect is clearly interested. I think I asked for the meeting at the perfect time during this call in particular.\n\nThe BAD:\n\n1.

        "content": " Beware of Fake Job Posts on LinkedIn! \n\nLately, I‚Äôve come across several fake pages posting job openings that don‚Äôt actually exist. What‚Äôs even more concerning is that these pages seem to be connected, as they constantly comment on each other‚Äôs posts and artificially boost their follower count.\n\nA common pattern I‚Äôve noticed is that these pages never provide direct links to official company job postings. Instead, they redirect users to third-party platforms like Foundit or Unstop (which don‚Äôt even lead to the actual job postings but rather prompt users to create a profile on those platforms for every job link). This raises doubts about their legitimacy. Their goal seems to be engagement farming rather than genuinely helping job seekers.\n\nIt‚Äôs alarming that Linkedin's system is allowing such fake accounts to grow unchecked. These scams not only waste people‚Äôs time but also create false hope for those genuinely looking for opportunities.\n\nIf you‚Äôre job hunting, please be cautious! Always verify job postings by checking the official company website or trusted sources before applying. Also, avoid clicking on random external links shared by unfamiliar pages.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this trend?",

Here are some key techniques to help you achieve that:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ . ùó®ùòÄùó≤ ùóóùóÆùòÅùóÆùóôùóøùóÆùó∫ùó≤/ùóóùóÆùòÅùóÆùòÄùó≤ùòÅ ùóºùòÉùó≤ùóø ùó•ùóóùóó\n\nDataFrames and Datasets come with built-in optimization modules, thanks to the Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten project. They provide better performance compared to RDDs.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ . ùó¶ùó≤ùóøùó∂ùóÆùóπùó∂ùòáùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª\n\nUse Kryo serialization instead of Java serialization. Kryo is faster and more compact, offering up to 10x better performance.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ . ùóîùòÉùóºùó∂ùó± ùó¶ùóµùòÇùó≥ùó≥ùóπùó∂ùóªùó¥\n\nMinimize shuffling by using operations like `mapPartitions()` instead of `map()`, and `coalesce()` instead of `repartition()`.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ . ùóñùóÆùó∞ùóµùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóÆùóªùó± ùó£ùó≤ùóøùòÄùó∂ùòÄùòÅùó≤ùóªùó∞ùó≤\n\nCache frequently accessed data using `cache()` or `persist()` methods to reduce computation time and improve performance.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ . ùó¢ùóΩùòÅùó∂ùó∫ùó∂ùòáùó≤ ùóùùóºùó∂ùóªùòÄ\n\nUse broadcast joins for small datasets to avoid shuffling large amounts of data. This can significantly speed up join operations.\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ . ùóßùòÇùóªùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùó¶ùóΩùóÆùóøùó∏ ùóñùóºùóªùó≥ùó∂ùó¥ùòÇùóøùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóªùòÄ\n\nAdjust executor memory, cores, and other configurations based on your workload.

No matter how you feel.\n\nWhether it‚Äôs your career, your fitness, or any other goal in life -\nHave a vision for where you want to go.\n\nLet your vision be your destination.\nLet your plan be the roadmap.\nThen show up and execute.\n\nIf you struggle to create a clear vision for your health and fitness goals, I‚Äôm here to help.\n\nWith over 20 years as a strength and conditioning specialist, I‚Äôve helped over a thousand people design their roadmap for success. Let‚Äôs build yours.\n\n Visit. You're capable of so much more than you think. ",
