For about 2 years.\n\nThen….the reps were calling on the same people, again.\n\nAnd, again.\n\n The approach to the market didn’t fit the market.\n\nSo this firm adapted and moved to an account-based selling model.\n\n(They went to a relationship-building plan to win customers)\n\nThey knew it would take 12-36 months to win most accounts, so they prioritized those they believed they had the best chance of winning, and put in place plans to get in with each CEO and/or CFO of those accounts.\n\nThey’d still call some, but also visit in person, invite those people to events, and find other ways to engage.\n\nThey changed their approach based on the market.\n\nThe result? 20+% yoy growth...every year...\nThat's not the business porn you read about with 200% growth every year, but for most mortals, that's a great way to build wealth....\n\nYou know what Einstein says about compounding?\n\nSo my question to you is… is your strategy based on the market?\nOr on your preferences?\n\nThanks tofor the inspiration below.",

(but never say \"follow up\" to a client)\n\nAt first, the changes seemed too small to matter. But over time? They compounded in ways I couldn’t have imagined.\n\nIf you’re chasing a “magic bullet” to sales success, stop. Instead, ask yourself:\nWhat’s one small skill I can sharpen today?\n\nBecause the real secret to sales success isn’t a tactic—it’s consistency, growth, and patience.\n\nWhat’s one small improvement you’re working on today?",

The initiative involves partnerships with OpenAI and Oracle, starting with a $100 billion AI data center in Texas. SoftBank’s CEO also expanded their investment commitment to $500 billion.\n\n• Following the Stargate AI initiative announcement, tech stocks surged. Oracle’s stock rose 7%, reflecting investor optimism around the major AI investment.\n\n• AI was a key topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos, with CEOs such as Elon Musk expressing confidence in AI’s growth potential, particularly in startups.\n\n• In Scotland, researchers are developing NeurEye, an AI tool that analyzes eye scans to detect early signs of dementia. With nearly a million scans collected, the goal is to identify patterns that could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention.\n\n• AI is being deployed to review CCTV footage in the Noah Donohoe case, using advanced algorithms to quickly flag human appearances for investigators.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these latest AI developments?

Without this, we risk building the most powerful systems humanity has ever seen with no compass to guide them.\n\n▪️■ 𝗔 𝗕𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗠𝗶𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿: Data nationalism isn’t just a policy problem; it’s a crisis of imagination. If AI mirrors our world, and our data becomes tribal, we’ll create fragmented, myopic intelligences that deepen global divides. What if America led the creation of a global data commons, where AI learns from humanity’s diversity while protecting sovereignty and privacy?\n\n▪️■◼️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝗜 𝗜𝘀𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺: The U.S. is fixated on securing\nfor its borders. But true leadership means exporting hope, not just technology. Why not create an AI Global Peace Corps—deploying tools to solve humanity’s hardest problems? From climate modeling to food innovation, AI’s power lies in solving global challenges that no single country can tackle alone.\n\nThe Blueprint gets the hardware right—but 𝗔𝗜 𝗶𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗿𝗶𝗱𝘀. No doubt, they are important. It’s about designing the soul of our future systems.
