For about 2 years.\n\nThen‚Ä¶.the reps were calling on the same people, again.\n\nAnd, again.\n\n The approach to the market didn‚Äôt fit the market.\n\nSo this firm adapted and moved to an account-based selling model.\n\n(They went to a relationship-building plan to win customers)\n\nThey knew it would take 12-36 months to win most accounts, so they prioritized those they believed they had the best chance of winning, and put in place plans to get in with each CEO and/or CFO of those accounts.\n\nThey‚Äôd still call some, but also visit in person, invite those people to events, and find other ways to engage.\n\nThey changed their approach based on the market.\n\nThe result? 20+% yoy growth...every year...\nThat's not the business porn you read about with 200% growth every year, but for most mortals, that's a great way to build wealth....\n\nYou know what Einstein says about compounding?\n\nSo my question to you is‚Ä¶ is your strategy based on the market?\nOr on your preferences?\n\nThanks tofor the inspiration below.",

With the announcement of Stargate, a $500 billion initiative backed by SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI, the U.S. is doubling down on its AI infrastructure.

America isn‚Äôt just competing for innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs competing to define the moral operating system of AI. We need a global AI Constitution that governs not just what AI does but how it does it.

If AI mirrors our world, and our data becomes tribal, we‚Äôll create fragmented, myopic intelligences that deepen global divides.
