After 2 years, I joined Kaspersky as PR and Marketing Manager. I quickly advanced within the company, becoming responsible for Communications and Public Affairs for Italy and South East Europe.\n\nℹ️ What is the most appealing thing to you about working in cyber security?\n\nAs my mission is to create a safer future, I’m not only concerned about the well-being of the world in a digital capacity. Gender equality, accessible knowledge, volunteering, paying attention to children, animal protection and other similar issues are really important to me. Kaspersky creates many social projects aimed at changing the everyday lives of people for the better.\n\n Name a book/movie that has inspired you. Anything specific to cyber security that you would recommend?\n\nVirginia Woolf, “A Room of One’s Own”.\n\n\n I recommend you to follow her , like and comment on this post to share her example, and perhaps suggest others to showcase !\n\n>>> This profile is part of a series I’m publishing every other day in collaboration with @Women4Cyber Foundation, follow me to receive the next updates.",

On The AI Space Podcast, Brad Messer (Structure AI) shares his predictions with host Sanjay Kalluvilayil, highlighting the rise of AI agents and specialized AI models. These aren’t just theoretical concepts anymore—AI agents are now entering production, helping businesses automate workflows, optimize decisions, and reduce operational costs.\n\nOne of the biggest shifts we’re seeing is the movement toward smaller, discipline-specific AI models that offer greater accuracy and efficiency. Instead of massive, general-purpose AI models, businesses are opting for targeted solutions that drive real-world impact.\n\nWatch the full episode here:to explore the cutting-edge AI trends defining 2025!",

        "content": "Manufacturing sales is getting hacked  and you might be the last to know\n\nEver feel like your RFQs vanish into a black hole? Or that your sales cycle moves slower than a fax machine stuck in 1998?\nMeanwhile, your competitors are out there closing deals before you even get past “Just following up…”. How? Because manufacturing sales isn’t just evolving—it’s getting a full-blown tech makeover️.\n\nHere’s how tech is rewriting the sales playbook (and why your competitors are secretly laughing at you):\n\n1️⃣ Dynamic Pricing is Killing ‘Let Me Get Back to You’ Quotes\nRemember when pricing was simple? Yeah, neither do I. AI-driven dynamic pricing now adjusts in real-time based on demand, material costs, and competitor moves. Buyers get instant, data-backed quotes. Reps stop fumbling with spreadsheets. More closed deals, less “waiting on approvals.\n\n2️⃣ Industrial Marketplaces Are Making Cold Outreach Obsolete\nBuyers are shopping for machines like they shop for sneakers—scrolling through industrial marketplaces like Xometry and Alibaba. If your company isn’t optimized for digital discovery, you’re losing deals before your sales team even gets a chance.\n\n3️⃣ Augmented Reality (AR) is Replacing Factory Visits\nWhy spend thousands flying a prospect in when AR can drop them inside your factory from their laptop? Customers can see real-time simulations of your machines in their workspace, eliminating objections and speeding up the sales cycle. No more ‘Let me think about it’—they’ve already seen it in action.\n\n4️⃣ Digital Twins Are Doing the Selling for You\nNo more “Trust me, it’ll work.” Instead, sales teams are using digital twins—real-time, 3D replicas of a customer’s factory—showing exactly how your product fits in. Prospects see the ROI before they buy, and your sales team skips weeks of back-and-forth.\n\n5️⃣ No More ‘Who Do I Call?’—AI Agents Are Fixing Salesforce Chaos\nManaging hundreds of leads, RFQs, and follow-ups? AI-powered sales agents prioritize the hottest deals, automate outreach, and remind reps exactly who to call, when, and what to say. (Because let's be honest—Excel isn’t cutting it anymore.)\n\n6️⃣ Your Website is Now Your Best Salesperson\nOld-school manufacturers treat their websites like a business card. Modern manufacturers treat it like a 24/7 sales rep. High-performing B2B sites now offer instant quotes, interactive product demos, and automated lead qualification—because buyers don’t want to wait for a rep to respond.\n\nThe Bottom Line?\nManufacturing sales is no longer about who has the best cold call game. It’s about who sells smarter, faster, and with less friction \n\nOur AI agents are helping manufacturers stay ahead, but we know every team tackles this challenge differently. How do you keep your salesforce sharp and responsive?\nDrop your thoughts in the comments—I’d love to hear what’s working for you!",

That’s where the magic happens!\n\nWhat’s your take? Let’s discuss in the comments!\n\nP.S. My book is exclusively available in the World Book fair till 9th feb. Global Online Launch On 11th Feb. ️",
