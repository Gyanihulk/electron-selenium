The Gossip King/Queen\n↳ Thrives on drama and loves to spill secrets.\n↳ Remember: If they gossip with you, they’re probably gossiping about you.\n\n2. The Bare Minimum Enthusiast\n↳ Coasts - doing just enough to stay out of trouble.\n↳ Their lack of drive can drain team morale—and yours.\n\n3. The Chronic Complainer\n↳ Always has something to gripe about—deadlines, management, even the office snacks.\n↳ Negativity is contagious. Protect your mindset.\n\n4. The Credit Snatcher\n↳ Eager to take the glory for work they didn’t do.\n↳ Make your contributions visible to the right people.\n\n5. The Over-Sharer\n↳ Turns team meetings into their personal therapy session.\n↳ Their chaos will derail your focus if you’re not careful.\n\n6. The Passive-Aggressive Saboteur\n↳ Smiles to your face but chips away at you behind.\n↳ Spot the signs early, set firm boundaries, and don’t let their games go unchecked.\n\n7. The Blame Dodger\n↳ Never takes accountability and always finds a scapegoat.\n↳ Don’t let their lack of ownership fall on your shoulders.\n\n You don’t choose your colleagues,\nbut you do choose who influences your growth.\n\nThe people you surround yourself?\nWill either elevate you—or drag you down.\n\nYour career deserves better.\nChoose wisely.\n\n️ Repost this - your network needs to hear it.\n Followfor more.",

Quota became a lagging indicator, not the north star\n\n\nIn the full episode, we covered:\n\n- Why hiring top performers from tech giants doesn't guarantee success\n- How AI is transforming enablement and course creation (3-minute course, anyone?)\n- The power of practice before execution\n- Building a culture of continuous learning in a high-growth environment\n\n\nWant to hear more about building a learning-first sales culture?\n\nCheck out the full conversation in the comments ",

People trust people, not logos.\n\nYour audience wants to see:\n\n- The strategist behind the strategy\n- The visionary behind the vision\n- The leader behind the success\n\nReal example: One of my clients, Dan, was stuck relying solely on his company's brand and in-person events.\n\nAfter building his personal brand on LinkedIn:\n→ Added $13k+ in recurring revenue\n→ Generated $50k in consulting deals\n→ Created multiple revenue streams\n\nThe truth? Your personal brand isn't competing with your company brand. It's amplifying it.\n\nEvery post from a founder carries more weight than a corporate message.\nEvery insight you share builds trust that logos can't create.\nEvery story you tell adds humanity that marketing can't buy.\n\nStop hiding behind your company logo.\nStart building your magnetic personal brand.",

A consultancy gained significant revenue growth in 6 months with the same team size.\n\nThe real question isn't whether you can afford to solve your lead generation challenges.
