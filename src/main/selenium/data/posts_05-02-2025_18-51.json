The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

The key to long-term wealth lies in strategic savings and investments.\n\nOne lesson I wish I learned earlier in my career? Diversify your investments. \n\n Last year, both the NIFTY50 and Sensex delivered just 5.9% and 5.4% returns in USD terms—barely outperforming a bank FD. Meanwhile, the US markets (driven by tech, AI, and semiconductors) saw impressive returns of 29% (Nasdaq) and 23.3% (S&P 500)!\n\nThis sharp contrast shows how crucial global diversification is to building wealth.\n\n Why is this important right now?\nWith the USD at an all-time high of 86.65 vs the INR, it’s a good time to protect your portfolio from INR depreciation and leverage the USD’s growth.\n\n If you're wondering how to tap into global opportunities, platforms like Vested Finance make it seamless to create a diversified portfolio with access to over 10,000 US Stocks & ETFs.\n\nDon't just rely on local markets—start building a truly global portfolio today! \n\nYou should definitely check it out :\nExplore Vested to diversify your investments and get a $10 bonus by signing up:\n\nDisclaimer:\nPlease note that the creator of this content is a client of(Vested) and has been paid compensation by Vested for his endorsement.

You might find it similar to what we do in India, like you choose an app, say Zerodha or Groww and you buy the stocks, the stocks are credited in your Demat account and SEBI or government regulates it.\nWhile if you are purchasing a stock say from Ind Money or Vested, whatever... Your stocks are not your own and neither you have any Demat account to store your shares, the broker buys the share on your behalf and it is kept in their account and reflected in your account. There's no role of regulatory compliances for you as an investor, if something goes wrong no one will be responsible, no SEC, no NASDAQ no SEBI and no US or Indian government.\n\nI am not saying them fraud, but keep this in mind, it's always risky when you are investing your money in market as a retail, when choose to invest outside India you have an extra risk as cherry on the cake.",

        "content": "Jeff, I appreciate your insights on the challenges surrounding consultants and solution providers in the NIL era. Your perspective highlights a critical issue—the need for genuine value beyond relationships, especially in such a fast-evolving landscape.\n\nWhile much of the current conversation is centered around the \"hot topics\" of NIL collective payments, transfer portals, and pay-for-play models—issues that primarily impact the top 2% of college athletes—I believe we're overlooking a significant opportunity. I focus on 98% of student-athletes who aren't navigating million-dollar deals or eyeing professional sports careers. These athletes represent the heart of college athletics, and their needs extend far beyond the transactional nature of NIL.\n\nWhat if we shifted the narrative? Instead of reacting to the chaos, let's proactively support these athletes through life skills, personal development, and professional growth programs. By investing in their holistic development, colleges can cultivate more loyal alumni, engaged fanbases, and well-rounded individuals who carry their positive experiences into the broader community.\nThis isn't just about compliance or keeping pace with trends. It's about leadership—recognizing that true success in college athletics isn't solely measured by revenue or media headlines, but by the lasting impact on the lives of student-athletes. When administrators embrace this broader vision, they'll find not just solutions, but sustainable growth and a stronger, more resilient athletic culture.\nThanks again for sparking this important conversation. I'm committed to leading in this space, ensuring that the 98% are not just seen, but truly supported.",

That’s not a great way to start a new role either.\n\n\nSo what do you even say?\n\nHere’s the thing—this question forces people into a corner. It makes the interview about the past instead of the future.\n\nImagine asking someone on a first date, “Why did you break up with your ex?”\nExactly. Awkward.\n\n\nBut if you have to answer it, here’s how to:\n Soften the negatives without being fake.\nFor example, instead of saying, “My boss micromanaged everything,” try “I’m looking for a role where I can take more ownership and grow independently.”\n\n Shift the focus to the new opportunity.\nTalk about what excites you about this job and how it aligns with your goals.\n\n Keep it positive and authentic. Be pleasant while you answer—it shows you’ve moved on and are focused on the future.\n\n\nMost people leave jobs for pretty common reasons—lack of growth, bad culture fit, or just wanting something more aligned with their goals.\n\nSo instead of digging for red flags, maybe it’s time we focus on where people want to go, not just where they’ve been.\n\nWhat’s your take? Should we retire this question?",
