We decided on pancakes. Simple enough, right?\n\nBut here’s the twist: I challenged myself to sell them without directly asking anyone to buy.\n\nInstead, I did three things:\n\nCreated curiosity – I brought out the pancakes with a little extra flair: warm syrup dripping down, the smell wafting into the air. People naturally turned their heads.\n\nTold a story – Instead of shouting, “Buy my pancakes!” I started casually chatting with passersby: “You know, this recipe was passed down from my grandma. She used to make this for me every Sunday.” Instantly, people connected emotionally.\n\nOffered a sample – I broke off tiny bites and handed them out. Before I knew it, people were asking me how much they were.\n\nBy the end of the day, we sold out—all without saying, “Please buy.”\n\nThe beautiful thing about this story is that we sold out during exam period ( and Exam periods in my school were always a time when most students were either completely broke or trying to manage the little they had left)\n\nThis experience taught me one of the most valuable lessons in marketing: People buy with their emotions first before buying logic logically.\n\nWhether you’re selling pancakes or pitching a service, remember: Storytelling builds trust, curiosity sparks interest and value seals the deal.\n\nPS- The image below is a rare picture of me in my natural hair\n\nWhat’s one simple product or service you’ve marketed in a creative way? Let me know in the comment\n\nI'm, follow for more.",
