From inspiring keynotes to hands-on workshops, the energy and ideas shared were truly transformative. New Orleans provided the perfect backdrop for collaboration, learning, and a little bit of fun (because, let’s be honest, it’s NOLA ).\n\nBut here’s the thing—conferences aren’t just about the sessions or the networking. They’re about taking what we’ve learned and turning it into action.\n\n **Now’s the Time to Act**\nThe insights, strategies, and connections we gained last week have the power to drive real change in our organizations and industries. Whether it’s implementing new technologies, optimizing processes, or fostering innovation, the real value of PTC User 2025 lies in what we do next.\n\nI’m excited to kick off this year with theteam and start making an impact. Let’s not let the momentum fade—let’s turn inspiration into transformation.\n\nTo everyone I was with in New Orleans: thank you for the conversations, the collaboration, and the shared vision for the future. Let’s stay connected and keep pushing boundaries together. \n\nWhat value did you take away from the conference?",

Here’s how to make the most of these sites:\n\n1. Use Custom Search Filters: Narrow down your results by using filters for remote roles, industry, and job type. Set job alerts to stay ahead of new listings.\n\n2. Tailor Your Resume: Highlight remote-specific skills like self-motivation, time management, and virtual collaboration to make your resume stand out.\n\n3. Network on LinkedIn: Connect with hiring managers and fellow remote workers. Join groups focused on remote work for exclusive job leads.\n\n4. Stand Out with Personalization: When applying on sites like We Work Remotely or AngelList, make your cover letter specific to the company and role. Show you understand their mission and remote culture.\n\n5. Prepare for Video Interviews: Practice for virtual interviews by ensuring your tech works and presenting yourself professionally.\n\n6. Develop Remote-Friendly Skills: Be sure your resume includes key skills for remote work—tools like Slack, Zoom, or Asana are highly sought after.\n\nRemote jobs are more accessible than ever in 2025—stay proactive, personalize your approach, and embrace the flexibility of working from home! Happy job hunting!",

Get it done first, and the rest of your day will feel lighter.\n\n2/ The Pomodoro Technique\n\nWork for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Short bursts of focus beat distractions every time.\n\n3/ The 2-Minute Rule\n\nIf a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. It’s a small action, but the momentum it creates is massive.\n\n4/ The 1-3-5 Method\n\nPlan your day by tackling:\n\n1 big task.\n3 medium tasks.\n5 small tasks.\n\nThis method prevents overwhelm and keeps you moving forward.\n\n5/ The Eisenhower Matrix\n\nCategorize your tasks:\n\nDo: Urgent & important\nDelegate: Urgent but not important\nDecide: Important but not urgent\nDelete: Neither urgent nor important\n\nThis technique makes prioritization simple and effective.\n\n6/ Getting Things Done (GTD)\n\nList every task.\n\nHandle the quick ones right away.\nSchedule the rest for when you have more time.\n\nIt’s perfect for long-term clarity and planning.\n\n7/ The Pickle Jar Theory\n\nImagine your time as a jar. Fill it with the big rocks first - your most important tasks. Sand (distractions) comes last.\n\nBonus: Task Batching\n\nGroup similar tasks and complete them together. Emails, calls, or brainstorming. Handle them all in one focused block of time.\n\nThe beauty of these methods?\n\nThey’re flexible.\n\nTry them.\nMix them.\nFind what works best for you.\n\nBecause time is not just hours on a clock.\n\nIt’s the currency of your life.\n\nWhat you spend it on today defines the life you’ll have tomorrow.\n\n- - -\n\nP.S.

Today, I’m thrilled to share that we’ve raised $2 million to take this vision even further.\n\nWe’re grateful to welcome Tim Draper, 468 Capital, Embedding VC, and the Dropbox co-founder to our cap table, alongside some of the best angels in AI, hardware, and open-source.\n\nThanks to the thousands of developers and early adopters building with us, we’ve seen incredible growth since launch:\n- Omi’s open-source ecosystem now has 6,000+ developers and 250+ apps built in just months.\n- Our AI wearable is live and shipping—and the demand is only growing.\n- We’re pushing the boundaries of brain-computer interfaces (BCI)—with plans to ship the first BCI developer kit this year.\n\nThis is just the start.\n\nAlong with this fundraise, I’d like to share a few major updates:\n New AI Hardware, New Era\nOur next-gen consumer device is coming—with a focus on real-time AI assistance, seamless integrations, and a mind-blowing user experience.\n\n Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) Are Here\nOmi isn’t just about voice AI—we believe in the future of thought-powered computing. This round will help us ship our first BCI developer kit, allowing builders to experiment with AI-driven neurotech.\n\n We’re Building an Elite Team\nThe best technology is built by the best people. We’re hiring top-tier AI engineers, hardware builders, and software devs to push the limits of what’s possible.\n\n Join Us\nIf you’ve built consumer hardware, AI models, or mind-blowing projects, we want you on board.\n The fastest way to join?

Traveling always reminds me of how important connecting face-to-face is and I’m so grateful for the opportunities to learn, grow, and share experiences with so many amazing people.\n\nBut if there’s one thing this trip reinforced, it’s how much I cherish being home. There’s nothing quite like walking through the door to a precious kiss from my wife, the laughter of my family, a big hug from my granddaughter, and the enthusiastic wagging tails of my dogs\n\nBeing away always makes me appreciate the little things—the quiet mornings with a cup of coffee, the shared meals around the table, and the comfort of simply being together. It’s in these moments that I feel most grounded, most loved, and most *me*.\n\nTo my incredible wife, my loving family, and my furry companions—thank you for being my safe harbor, my joy, and my heart. Coming home to you is the best part of every adventure. \n\nAnd to everyone I connected with during my travels—thank you for the memories, the inspiration, and the reminders of why I do what I do. Here’s to staying connected, even from afar, and to the next chapter of adventures—both near and far.",

Unless there is receipt given to me with the proof attached on how my money you collected from me is used it's legal bribe. India is suffering from tax without accountability. I am not against tax. Am against tax being collected and still having to walk on pot filled roads to office.\n\nThe same tax money will never be used to build a digital accountability framework. A simple backend that allows the common middle man to track destination of expenses the govt has done on behalf of collecting tax along with the proof.\n\nThe biggest scam is the yearly budget to see which dept gets money. You need to follow through by proving every single penny you took as tax reached the end destination. Without a digital accountability framework for the public to see non security and defence related expenses it's broad steeling in daylight.\n\nThe biggest lolipop was that they did not mention how any investment is being done to increase the number of tax payers. If you fell for this temporary relief you are no different from a freebie acceptor. Please don't cheat the public: take money from us and neither my children nor my ancestors benefit from an improved infra. Be accountabl",

But here’s the reality: no one cares about your goals unless they align with theirs.\n\nThis is where my\napproach comes in.\n\nBefore you send an email, pick up the phone, or craft a LinkedIn message, stop and ask yourself: “Am I talking about what matters most to my prospect?”\n\nTaking the time to create email copy and phone talk tracks that align with their priorities is critical.\n\nThis is not about prospect-specific personalization. This is about RELEVANCE.\n\n\n️ Here’s why:\n\nRelevance drives response.\n\nWhen you speak to the challenges and goals that matter the most to your prospect, you’re no longer interrupting them—you’re engaging them.\n\nWant to stand out in 2025?\n\nBelieve me when I say the bar is low and stealing this strategy will help you 2x your results this year.\n\nMost outreach is about the seller: “We offer X,” “Our platform does Y.”\n\nFlip the script by focusing on the prospect’s world instead, and you instantly differentiate yourself.\n\nTrust builds faster when your messaging reflects that you’ve done the homework.\n\nIn 2025, relevance isn’t just important—it’s essential.\n\nBuyers are busier than ever, and generic outreach is the quickest way to get ignored.\n\nWhen your outreach centers on what truly matters to your prospects, you earn the right to their time, their attention, and eventually, their business.\n\n\n How are you ensuring your team’s messaging speaks to what matters most to your prospects?",

Pronouns was one. DEI preaching ‘check your privilege, old white man!’ was another.\n\nOne of the saddest reflections about November’s campaign came from Tim Miller, a Republican ‘Never Trumper’ who campaigned energetically for Harris/Walz. ‘We didn’t ask for anything, just to be allowed to add our voices to the campaign’ he observed (I’m paraphrasing). ‘But the Left were not on board, undermining the campaign with protests about Gaza outside the DNC.’ And if we look at the numbers, it wasn’t that Trump won — Democrats lost by alienating swing-voters with these kinds of antics (not just in November, but over the last four years).\n\nSome people clearly care passionately about pronouns, but were they worth losing to Trump over?",

These seem to be key to improvements over the next four years according to Reeves. The focus on the Heathrow third runway, big projects.\n\nWhat about small ones? What choices can we make to help that? Just like turning down the thermostat by x degrees helps reduce energy use (and your energy bill) by y amount. Just like the GB cycling team improving everything by 1% led to big gains that Olympic year. What if we could all contribute to that?

Leading up to the second win, we saw a trans last supper open the Olympics, and a Jaguar commercial with trans models. Maybe we liberals were just too excited about gains in trans rights, but to many I think it felt like trans was being shoved down their throats, and there was some real push back.\n\nFrom the little I saw of Kamalas campaign from here in England, she seemed to be leaning into the woke image rather than clearly standing with the working class on important issues.\n\nThe pronouns debate also leaves me internally conflicted. At many non profit events, we all get up and give our name and our pronouns. I understand it is to emphasize that you can't guess someone's pronouns from their appearance, and to thus make trans people more comfortable sharing theirs. Still, I've never been misgendered and to me this felt really performative. It felt like a somewhat arbitrary thing for me to have to clarify when introducing myself. What about where I grew up, or my ethnicity? I've actually had my ethnicity mistaken many times, so that might be of more use.",

The internet is not a courtroom, but people treat it like one—rushing to judgment with zero fact-checking.\n\nIt’s wild how often outrage is based on clips without context, headlines without substance, and opinions without research. And once the mob decides something, good luck changing their minds.\n\nYou don’t have to like someone to be fair about them. You don’t have to agree with everything they say to listen. But forming opinions without thinking critically? That’s how misinformation spreads like wildfire.\n\nThe real question is- Are people actually interested in the truth, or just in reinforcing their existing beliefs?",

Living With Integrity - this means living your values every single day. Which includes trying your hardest at whatever you do.\n\n2. Growth - this requires having ambitious goals that require you to grow and change to achieve them.\n\n3. Connection - Nurturing and spending time on the relationships that matter most in your life\n\n4. Contribution - knowing that the work we do every day is meaningful and serves others.\n\nWhen you shift from focusing on extrinsic goals to intrinsic goals, everything else improves.\n\nIn this training video, I share how to make this shift, and why it’s so important to your long term happiness, fulfillment, and success.",

You do the job, everything works—great.\n\nThen they call you back: “Hey, I played around with it and it stopped working again.” You go back, fix it again.\n\nThen they call you again—“I through a hammer on it, it’s out again.” You’d probably think, Why do they keep breaking it?\n\nWhy am I even here if they’re just going to undo my work?\n\nNow, let’s talk about this week Parsha - פרשת בא.\n\nHashem tells Moshe to go to Pharaoh and demand he release the Jews. But here’s the twist—Hashem also \"hardens Pharaoh’s heart\", making him refuse.\n\nOver and over again, Moshe pleads, Pharaoh resists, another plague comes, and the cycle repeats.\n\nIf you were Moshe, wouldn’t you ask, Why am I doing this if You’re the one making him say no?\n\nThe commentators explain: Hashem didn’t just want to free the Jews—He wanted to change them.\n\nGrowth happens through resistance.\n\nIf Pharaoh had just given in right away, the transformation wouldn’t have been as deep.\n\nNow, back to business.\n\nAs a leader, consultant, electrician, or fractional CMO, you’ll face this too. You fix a problem, and leadership (or the market) undoes your progress.\n\nYou guide a team, and they resist change.\n\nYou lay out a strategy, but people stick to their old habits.\n\nIt’s frustrating—but that’s where the real work happens.\n\nThe job isn’t just to fix things—it’s to help people through the process of change.\n\nResistance isn’t failure; it’s part of the transformation.\n\nEver faced a “Pharaoh moment” in your work?\n\nHow did you handle it?",
