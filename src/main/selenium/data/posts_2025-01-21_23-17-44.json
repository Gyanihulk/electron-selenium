So excited to reflect a little on how we got here and spend a whole ton of time on where we are going!\n\nOne of my favorite traditions we do is havedress up as his alter-ego, Mr. Mobly and hand out our team-voted superlatives. Similar to Dwight Shrute's Recyclops, he takes it to a new level each time.\n\nThis year he is wearing a Harry Christmas orange tux from Dumb & Dumber and using a ChatGPT-generated Stefon-style monologue to present each award.\n\nMy personal favorite superlative this year is for, who was voted \"Most Likely to Miss The Kickoff Due to Forgetting About an Out of Country Scuba Diving Trip\" (yes....this is a recurring thing...)\n\nWhat's the best superlative you've ever seen/received?",
