No biggie. After spending 30 seconds digging around in my mouth my doctor looked straight into my eyes and delivered the potential diagnosis.\n\nI was shook to my core.\n\nI tried to be brave, but the second I got to my car I burst into hysteria, unsure how to tell my family or what to do next. What. The. Actual. F?\n\nAfter a few phone calls I was able to get a same day appointment with a specialist (what are the odds). My wife was on her way in to meet me when the new doctor took a look and assured me that I was going to be okay.\n\nAn hour later, the lump was removed from my lip. My new doctor was confident it wasn't cancer, and they were sending it off to be tested just in case.\n\nEven though this whole experience only lasted a few hours, it was an emotionally exhausting day & weekend. It really makes you sit back and evaluate what is truly important in this life.\n\nFor me: that's spending meaningful time with my wife & my kids. Everything else comes second. A distant second. A very distant second.",

Business Assets\n\nThe foundation of wealth building.\n\nWhen you buy an existing business, you get:\n‚Ä¢ Both tangible and intangible value\n‚Ä¢ Working systems and processes\n‚Ä¢ Proven cash flow from day one\n‚Ä¢ Established customer base\n\n2. Real Estate\n\nTiming is critical here.\n\nWait until your business generates consistent cash flow, then:\n‚Ä¢ Use that cash flow to acquire strategic properties\n‚Ä¢ Leverage physical assets as collateral\n‚Ä¢ Create stability in your portfolio\n‚Ä¢ Build long-term appreciation\n\n3. Intellectual Property\n\nThis is what separates the wealthy from the ultra-wealthy:\n\n‚Ä¢ Patents, trademarks, content\n‚Ä¢ Passive income generation\n‚Ä¢ Unlimited scaling potential\n‚Ä¢ No physical limitations\n\nThe magic happens when you combine these assets correctly, they multiply each other:\n\n‚Ä¢ Business cash flow funds real estate investments\n‚Ä¢ Real estate provides collateral for expansion\n‚Ä¢ IP creates new opportunities for both\n\nBut there's one important thing you must not forget...\n\nDon't try to do everything at once.\n\nStart with one business. Get it generating consistent cash flow.\n\nThen expand strategically into real estate and IP.\n\nThe framework I've shared isn't theory - it's exactly what I've done to build sustainable wealth that:\n‚Ä¢ Generates consistent cash flow\n‚Ä¢ Appreciates over time\n‚Ä¢ Can be passed down generationally\n\nYou don't need to start from scratch.\n\nIn fact, buying an existing business is often the fastest path to financial freedom.\n\nWant to learn more about buying businesses?\n\nGet my weekly newsletter here ‚Üí",

Combining operating businesses with real estate and IP creates a self-reinforcing ecosystem: cash flow fuels acquisitions, assets drive stability, and IP unlocks scalable growth. Success hinges on disciplined execution. Great advice to master one asset class before layering in others. This approach turns ambition into enduring legacy.",

Benchmarked performance: We know our numbers for our GAINS metrics. Pipeline Velocity, Sales Cycle by Stage, Win rate by Stage, NRR, and Rep Productivity\n\n2. Their Revenue Operations and Enablement groups aren't regulated to answering tickets and building reports or trainings the nobody looks at. They are strategically aligned to create incremental wins in the GAINS metrics.\n\n3. The sales reps ALL know their own numbers and have personalized development plans to improve the bottlenecks in their process. Reps can coach themselves.\n\n4. Front line leaders spend less time on pipeline conversations and more time building reps skills to impact the metric the rep is focused on. They stop \"checking in on deals\" and start \"working with Timmy on how we can increase win rate from stage 2 to 3\"\n\nPick ONE  of the above and watch what happens\n\nThat's it...andand I go hard on this on the AI Powered Seller Podcast - Episode three drops tomorrow!",
