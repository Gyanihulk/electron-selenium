      "content": "Big deal about to close... but it’s not the ICP?\n\nWhen I work on refining sales strategies for scale ups, I always include a validation step.\n\nIt comes after the proposal and negotiation.\n\nIt’s an internal step for:\n– The CEO or VP of Sales to review the deal.\n– The SDR or sales manager to self-analyze.\n– An item to discuss during weekly or monthly deal reviews.\n\nThe key focus of validation?\n\nDouble-check the customer still fits your ICP.\n\nIt’s overlooked because:\n– The SDR wants to hit quota.\n– The sales manager wants to hit quota.\n– Or simply, the revenue is too tempting to resist.\n\nBut if you’re serious about scaling to 8 or 9 figures, you must take this step.\n\nYou must reconsider going ahead if the ICP isn’t the right fit.\n\nHere’s why…\n\nI recently read a story from Jake Fuentes, co-founder of Cascade, about why he shut his startup down.\n\nHe admitted that “ICP fray” was a key factor.\n\nCascade initially defined their ICP as “nontechnical business analysts using Excel to crunch big data sets”.\n\nThe definition was too broad.\n\nThey ended up chasing customers with wildly different use cases:\n– A scooter company managing location data.\n– An HR team managing employee data.\n\nThey didn’t have a framework to accept or reject opportunities, so they tried to support them all.\n\nJake described this as “a slow death of a thousand cuts.”\n\nSupporting anyone and everyone pulled the company in a million directions, ultimately diluting their focus and stunting growth.\n\nIf you want to scale successfully, rejecting deals from prospects who don’t fit your ICP is the tough but necessary way forward.\n\nValidate every deal.\n\nStick to your guns.\n\nKeep closing.\n\nLike what you read? ️ Repost it to your network and follow Steve Litzow for more.\n\nWant to accelerate your sales?
