          "commentText": "This is SUPER interesting Alex Turnbull. As someone who sells devs for hire and team augmentation, I feel that the narrative around “less engineers = more productivity” is nuanced and context-dependent. Salesforce’s AI-first motion is impressive, but it reflects a very specific stage of maturity and scale. One where the systems, processes, and core products are already in place.\nFor smaller companies or startups, cutting back on engineers entirely would be counterproductive. In those environments, engineers aren’t just executing, they’re wearing multiple hats, problem-solving across disciplines, and helping shape the product vision. AI can assist, but it can’t fully replace that kind of adaptability and creativity.\nIt's why I talk a lot about a product mindset for engineering teams.",

      "content": "Some >$100M companies have their copywriters sticky-note these two words on their laptops. Can you guess what it is?\n\nWhen I started out, I learned about this word.\n\nBut when I heard some $100M companies have their copywriters sticky-note the words “Be specific” to their laptops - I knew I had to write a whole lesson on this.\n\nSo here goes:\n\nConsider these two positive statements --\n\n1) \"Achieving good health\"\n\n2) \"Feeling energetic enough to dance at your best friend's wedding\"\n\nThe first statement, \"achieving good health\", is generic and broad. Everyone wants to be healthy.\n\nBut the second paints a specific, joyous picture - that feeling of having so much energy and well-being that you can not only attend but actively participate in a celebratory moment.\n\nIt ties the concept of health to a very particular, happy occasion, making it much more vivid and relatable.\n\nThis is what specificity can do. Notice that it paints a picture in your head compared to “achieving good health”.\n\nNow, let’s look at a negative statement:\n\nEver felt the pang of \"not having enough money\"?\n\nIt stings, right?\n\nBut imagine “watching your friends jet off to world adventures while you're stuck on your couch scrolling through their Instagram stories”.\n\nHurts more, doesn't it? Again, that's the power of specificity. It paints a picture so vivid, so relatable, that readers are instantly hooked.\n\nHere’s why specificity works:\n\nIn the vast wilderness of the internet, where anyone can claim just about anything…\n\nSpecificity becomes your North Star. It lends you credibility. After all, only someone truly in-the-know would deal in specifics, right?\n\nBut there's more to specificity than just painting vivid images.\n\nSpecificity in numbers works too.\n\nConsider these two pitches:\n\n\"Over 2000 moms adore this stroller!\"\n\"Already 2781 moms trust this stroller for their little one's comfort.\"\n\nWhich one instantly feels more trustworthy? The latter, right?\n\nIt’s because 2000 looks very rounded off, whereas 2781 looks oddly specific.\n\nPRO TIP: There's a weird quirk we've observed over the years. Odd numbers perform better in copy. We don't know why, but it just does. So avoid using even numbers if you can.\n\n=====\n\nEnjoyed this quick lesson?

I must have tried at least 2 dozen times to \"nail down my ICP\" and failed miserably in doing so. But the minute I try to describe who might enjoy/learn from my content (my ideal \"human\" profile), it becomes incredibly easier... (and for those that might be curious - no, I am NOT a coach!)
