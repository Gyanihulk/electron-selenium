      "content": "I've been thinking more about brain efficiency. With my last startup I was doing polyphasic sleeping where I would go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 2:30am every day to work. You can do this if you are good at taking micro naps during the day. During that time I had feedback from an investor and my co-founder that I might need more sleep because I was showing signs of cognitive decay.\n\nRecently I was catching up with a CEO who mentioned their sleeping the last few months was on point, many nights getting the full 8hrs of sleep.\n\nSo here is my main question, between fighting for minimal sleep, and ideal sleep (aka sleep until your body wakes up) what is the ideal? I think the answer to that question is beyond human, I think it ultimately will come down to AI's assessment of our work.\n\nFor example, if you are programming, then all of the code you check in through git should be automatically analyzed and scored by an agent. Scored for it's unit of work (complexity, value, etc.. however you define that) and then your units of work should be tracked/day.\n\nIf you are producing more on the world's most terrible sleep schedule... there you go... if you are producing more on sleep closer to your ideal target (8hrs) there you go. I'm curious if anyone has done this level of tracking, also what tricks/tips to people use/do to maximize their cognitive throughput (e.g. lions mane, bacopa monnieri, omega-3, ginko biloba, vitamin B, cardio, ice baths, etc..).\n\nCurious what tips people have out there and what they do sleep-wise to maximize throughput at work.",
