I've dialed-in so well that I hit my first 6-figure week in 2025.\n\nI have 1 offer.\nNot 2.\nNot 3.\nNot 5.\n1.\n\nMost coaches are like busy chefs trying to:\n\nFigure out 12 special dishes at once.\nStretched thin. Stressed out.\nGasping for a big win.\n\nBut you only needed ONE signature dish. When I realized this and:\n\n- Crafted 1 offer for 1 target niche (coaches)...\n- Promoted it inside 1 free monthly workshop\n- And made it into 1 conversion protocol\n\nThen I found that success hides in subtraction, not addition. And when you experience this, then you get:\n\n- The courage to go narrow\n- The strength to say no\n- The power to simplify\n\nSometimes the bravest thing you can do is delete your to-do list and start over with just:\n\nONE thing.\n\nWhen you get this right, results accelerate.\n\nWhy 99% of Coaches should have 1 group coaching offer:",

But let’s look at the reality, and the potential risks of waiting.\n\nAs we approach SAP’s 2027 deadline, delaying your migration could bring several challenges:\n\nS/4HANA consulting rates have already increased 25-40% in the last two years. As demand grows, will you be ready for the potential cost spike?\n\nBy 2027, the demand for S/4HANA consultants could outpace the supply by 3x, which could make it harder to find qualified experts when the time comes.\n\nRushed Implementations = Increased Risk\n\nSAP migrations are complex. Postponing could lead to rushed implementations, which might cause:\n→ Data integrity issues\n→ Lengthier downtime\n→ Operational disruptions\n\n\nWhat’s the Path Forward?\n\nThe key is to start planning today, even if full migration isn’t on your priority list yet.\n\n1️⃣ Create a Strategic Roadmap\n→ Assess your current processes\n→ Set clear budgets and expectations\n→ Identify trusted migration partners\n\n2️⃣ Invest in Change Management\n→ Engaging your teams early makes the transition smoother\n→ Helps you maximize the full potential of the migration\n\n3️⃣ Consider Hybrid or Phased Approaches\n→ Moving some systems to the cloud first can simplify the transition\n→ Reduces complexity and spreads out costs",

Thank you, Jens, for this interesting exchange!!\n\nThe global healthcare sector is facing a pivotal moment. As‘s 2024 𝘎𝘭𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘭 𝘏𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘵𝘩𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘚𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳 𝘖𝘶𝘵𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬 shows, technological advancements like AI, telemedicine, and wearable health solutions are poised to reshape care delivery, improve patient outcomes, and streamline operations. Yet, rising costs, clinician shortages, and the demand for personalized, accessible care present significant challenges.\n\nKey insights from our study:\n\n𝗔𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 (𝗔𝗜)\nPredictive AI models can optimize staffing by forecasting patient volumes, while AI-enabled diagnostics can speed up radiological imaging by up to 60%.\n\n𝗦𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 & 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁\nBy 2026, the market for interoperable clinical data is expected to grow from $3.4 billion to $6.2 billion, reflecting a shift toward data-sharing innovations that improve efficiency.\n\n𝗥𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲\nTelehealth and virtual wards have expanded access to services, especially in rural areas, creating new preventive care possibilities at lower costs.\n\nIn our 𝘍𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘏𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘵𝘩 study, we outline the opportunities that advanced technologies present for the German healthcare system, depending on political decisions. Against the backdrop of the current discussions on healthcare funding, it is vital to seize these opportunities promptly, as they promise substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality.\n\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT! \nWhat are your thoughts on how the future of healthcare should look like in 2030?\n\n————————————-\n\n️ Share this to spread Tech for Good inspiration!\n Follow mefor more tech & innovation content!",
