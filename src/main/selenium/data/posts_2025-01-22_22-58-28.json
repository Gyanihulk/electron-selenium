I still use tools like ChatGPT to keep things conversational and context-aware. It understands what I‚Äôm working on and helps refine my queries in real-time.\n\n‚Üí For deeper dives, I lean on Perplexity‚Äîmy most-used tool. It‚Äôs fast, intuitive, and delivers concise answers to even the most complex questions. When I need something more detailed, I turn to, which breaks queries into multiple research angles, scans up to 150 sources, and compiles a thorough report. It takes a little longer but provides unmatched depth.\n\n‚Üí Then there‚Äôs Gemini Deep Search‚Äîperfect for massive data uploads. With its 2-million-token capacity (equivalent to about 1.5 million words!), I can summarize entire datasets or documents and format the output however I need.\n\nOnce I‚Äôve found what I‚Äôm looking for, AI helps me share insights effortlessly:\n‚Üí Notebook LM summarizes information, generates Q&A documents, and even turns content into podcasts for on-the-go learning.\n‚Üí Perplexity Pages lets me transform search results into shareable webpages.\n\nSo, What‚Äôs the Takeaway?\n\nAI has made research faster, smarter, and more actionable.\nWhether it‚Äôs digging into RFPs, summarizing market trends, or making data-driven decisions, these tools are more than just helpful‚Äîthey‚Äôre transformational.\n\nIf you want to start learning how to harness AI for your business\nJoin Cohort #10 of the AI Business Transformation Course starting February 17:\nÔ∏è 4 Mondays, 12-2 PM ET\n Learn how to use tools like Perplexity, Gemini, and more to transform data into strategy and more!\n\nJoin hundreds of professionals who‚Äôve already revolutionized their businesses with this course.\nLet‚Äôs make 2025 the year AI becomes your competitive edge.",
