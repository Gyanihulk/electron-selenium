      "content": "Continuing our 2025 post series with number 8.\n\nSome of the PlayBooked team, Chloe V. Mitchell, Patrick Werksma, and I had productive conversations regarding the impact of the Department of Education's recent statement on NIL and Title IX (\"Title 9\" for those who skipped the roman numeral day in middle school).\n\nParts of my post may be repetitive, be patient with me while I work out the true implications of attempting to write a series. Yes I know we aren't on the 8th day of the year. I will have to play some catch up at some point.\n\nhas cleared the path for Universities to pay NIL money directly to athletes. Much simpler, right? While collectives certainly have a place in acting as fan clubs and co-ordinating crowd-sourced donor-dollars to athletes and sourcing marketing deals, in some situations they have been a work-around for\ndollars. But that has changed, and schools, as long as the dollars can be justified (i.e. pay for marketing and not performance) can now pay athletes directly. And now...\n\nTHEY HAVE TO PAY FEMALE ATHLETES THE SAME AMOUNT. That's in the aggregate. Ifwants to give male football players and basketball players a combined $10M- yes that's a 10 with six zeros after it--they have to do the same for female athletes at their school.\n\nIt's a massive and fundamental change, but that's Title IX folks. The actual wording: ‚ÄúNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.‚Äù\n\nSo now what? Since nearly all of these schools receive Federal financial assistance in some form they all must comply. And now they must do so with their NIL dollars.\n\nDo schools cut non-revenue generating programs? Well if they do, they must do so for both male and female teams, but then, wait for it....that will work against them, since they will be dumping the same massive dollars into non revenue-generating female sports as they would the male revenue-generating sports! It be nearly impossible for a top tier school to efficiently use the same dollars to recruit a handful of women's athletes to their school. There will indeed be an arms race for top tier female talent in basketball, since it does generate revenue in many schools, but for the rest of the money, there is a conundrum- how to spend it?\n\nOr see this as a unique opportunity.\n\nElevate all of your women's teams. Push a disproportionate size of your NIL funds to a couple teams, then direct the rest for the betterment of all of your female athletes. What could tens of thousands of $ do to members of the track team, soccer team, lacrosse team who could focus on school and sports instead of an outside job? Matriculation rates rise, less students transfer, happy graduates, happy (eventual) donors.\n\nOr stop taking all federal money.",

These are all ways we find comfort in our preferred language.\n\nFor many Indians, this comfort lies in regional languages. This is especially true for older generations who may not be as proficient in multiple languages as their younger counterparts.

AI is no longer just a buzzword, but a vital tool that enhances operational efficiency, streamlines processes, and improves customer experiences. From automating repetitive tasks to providing deeper insights through data analysis, AI is reshaping how businesses operate and deliver value to their customers.\n\nWith AI's ability to adapt and learn, businesses can now make smarter decisions faster, reduce human error, and uncover opportunities that may have previously gone unnoticed. By integrating AI into various sectors such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, companies are gaining a competitive edge, improving their bottom lines, and staying ahead of market trends. The real potential of AI lies in its capacity to assist business leaders in making informed choices based on accurate, real-time data.\n\nAs AI continues to be integrated into business operations, its potential to reshape industries becomes more evident. With the right strategies and technologies in place, AI offers a pathway to long-term growth and innovation. Embracing AI today means positioning for a future where technology plays a key role in business success.\n\nTo watch the entire Human-AI Symbiosis with  Cedric Chin and Lia DiBello Ph.D on the Commoncog podcast, click here -",

The UK‚Äôs tax revenue is below the average of other developed G7 economies.\n\nBureaucracy: The notion that ‚Äúbureaucracy and regulations strangle any innovative ideas‚Äù is wrong. The UK government has implemented measures to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and support business innovation.\n\nAttitude Towards Wealth: If you feel that there‚Äôs ‚Äúa culture that sees wealth as something to apologise for,‚Äù perhaps it‚Äôs time to reassess your social circle.\n\nI‚Äôve successfully run businesses in the UK for over 35 years. Initiatives like the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) make it one of the most attractive environments for entrepreneurs.\n\nFrankly, too many so-called entrepreneurs are unwilling to put in the hard work required for success. They prefer flaunting images of private jets, luxury cars, and yachts rather than rolling up their sleeves.\n\nThe Labour government has been in power for less than 200 days and is addressing a ¬£22 billion tax deficit left by the previous Tory administration, which orchestrated one of the most significant acts of economic self-harm in modern history: Brexit.\n\nIt‚Äôs high time we focus on the opportunities and strengths within the UK rather than perpetually seeking excuses.",
