But what if you could reprogram your Reticular Activating System (RAS) to see opportunity instead of fear?\n\n Remember:\n\nYour unconscious mind doesn’t see reality; it sees what you imagine.\nLife isn’t happening to you; it’s happening through you.\nWhen you take responsibility, you unlock true power.\nYour life is a mirror of your mind. Shift your focus, and watch your world transform.\n\n What are you focused on today?\n\nBrooke ",
