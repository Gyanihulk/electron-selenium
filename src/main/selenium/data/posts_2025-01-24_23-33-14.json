      "content": " Culture isn’t an HR problem— it’s a leadership responsibility. Look up, not down.\n\nYou see, HR isn’t here to fix your leadership failures.\n\nBlaming HR for your toxic culture? That’s like blaming a mirror  for your reflection. \n\n What HR actually does:\nThey’re the strategists shaping your company’s core by:\n- Building top-notch hiring systems\n- Structuring fair and competitive pay\n- Mapping out clear career growth opportunities\n- Measuring employee engagement\n- Equipping managers to lead better\n- Keeping performance evaluations fair\n\n What HR can’t do:\n\nHR isn’t your corporate miracle worker. They can’t:\n- Force leaders to listen\n- Make absent executives show up\n- Fix deep-seated toxic behavior\n- Rebuild broken trust\n- Make leadership actually care.\n\nEven the best HR team can't fix leadership failures like:\n\n- Empty promises from the top\n- Leaders hiding behind closed doors\n- Ignoring employee concerns\n- Saying one thing but doing another\n- Modeling toxic behaviors themselves\n\nHR can’t outshine a disengaged leadership team.\n\nHR can’t fix what bad leadership breaks.\n\nCulture always flows from the top—leaders make or break it.\n\nIf leadership doesn’t give a damn, no HR initiative can save you.\n\nImage & quote credit: Wouter Durville",
