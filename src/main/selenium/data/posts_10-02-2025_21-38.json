Competitors are still active. The cost of inaction? Lost opportunities.\n\nSo what’s the solution?\n1. Control what you can - Create no-approval-needed, high-value content.\n2. Leverage local SEO & ads - Patients searching for care don’t need approvals to find you.\n3. Automate patient engagement - Reduce friction, increase appointments.\n4. Show results, not requests - Data can turn even disengaged clients into believers.\n\nIn my experience, waiting for approvals is a choice. Taking action is a strategy.\n\nGreat perspective, Sanchita!

Action creates confidence naturally\n\n2/ Confidence isn't about being liked\n↳ Your team needs someone real, not someone perfect\n\n3/ Confidence is built by what you do\n↳ Stop overthinking. Start doing. Growth follows action\n\n4/ Confidence grows by making tough decisions\n↳ Feel uncertain? Good leaders do. Make the call anyway\n\n5/ Confidence comes from stacking small wins\n↳ Each small victory adds up to lasting confidence\n\n6/ Failure isn't the opposite of great leadership\n↳ Every setback teaches. Every recovery makes you stronger\n\n7/ Your voice matters\n↳ Your team needs your perspective, even if you're nervous\n\n8/ Your self-talk is your internal leadership coach\n↳ Talk to yourself like you'd encourage your best teammate\n\n9/ True confidence isn't about perfection\n↳ Keep learning, keep growing. That's real leadership\n\n10/ You don't have to feel confident to lead\n↳ Your willingness to try inspires more than perfection\n\nRemember: Leadership isn't about feeling ready.\n\nIt's about being willing to start before you are.\n\n--------------------\n Repost and help your network build confidence.\n Follow Justin Hills for Actionable insights for high-performers who want to be highly effective leaders.",

I brought my son, faced countless challenges, and rebuilt our lives from scratch. Today, I’m a happy mother, wife, and entrepreneur, making things happen despite uncertainty.\n\nIn this episode, I share my journey—two years of struggles, victories, and lessons learned. We talk about life, friendship, business, my book, and the mindset needed to push forward.\n\nI’d love for you to listen, and I truly hope you find it inspiring.

Perfect for quick weather checks, useless for research papers. \n\nFlash Thinking Experimental :\n\n• Shows step-by-step reasoning before answers\n• Same 1M-token limit, but failed basic 2-page doc analysis\n• Transparency ≠ accuracy\nDeepSeek’s version is smoother—Gemini feels like a beta test. \n\nFlash Thinking Exp with App-Integrated Model:\n\nLeverages Google’s ecosystem (YouTube, Maps, Search). Example:\n\n“Find NYC coffee shops open past midnight with vegan options” → cross-references Maps + reviews. But outputs felt recycled from existing tools—no wow factor. ️\n\nWhy Free? \n\n• Pressure from DeepSeek/Qwen’s free tiers\n• ChatGPT’s dominance in advanced tasks\n• Google needs market share fast\n\nTheir play: accessibility over excellence. But will casual users care about AI wars?\n\nThe Good:\n• Built-in Android assistant = seamless quick queries\n• Gemini Deep Research (paid tool) crushes academic papers\n\nThe Bad:\n• Surface-level answers\n• Reliability issues in multi-step reasoning\n• No killer feature vs competitors \n\nVerdict:\n\nAs an Android user, I keep Gemini for quick tasks (emails, simple math).\n\nChatGPT/DeepSeek still rule. Google’s models are a solid entry point—but power users will look elsewhere.\n\nYour Move:\n\nWould you trade depth for speed? Or stick with proven tools? Let’s debate below!  Follow for more AI breakdowns.",

He's also hilarious!\n\nThe book is all about God. Actually, God and you.\n\nIt's down to earth, real, and simultaneously intellectually and emotionally engaging, a rare combination.\n\nThe book will transform your understanding and connection to God and along with that, your understanding and connection to yourself.\n\nThe book doesn't just teach how to understand God, it teaches how to experience God and his Love.\n\nI've told many of my clients about this book, many of them reported that's its transformed their spirituality as well.\n\nOne particular client of mine was an older, retired man, a lifelong atheist. One session he mentioned a dream he had that had something to do with God. He told me it intrigued him and wanted to explore more.\n\nI told him about this book.\n\nHe read the book, and was electrified.\n\nHe now believes in God.\n\nThe book doesn't get into debates about the existence of God. It just presents an understanding that makes God irresistible.\n\nThis client is not Jewish. The book is about the Jewish understanding of God but it would appealing to anyone interested in a deeper understanding and connection to God and to themselves.\n\nHave you read any books that have transformed you? What book?\n\n_______________________________\nI offer in person and online therapy for High Achievers with High Stress.

Because leadership isn’t about having the answers—it’s about guiding others to take ownership of them.\n\nWhen you ask the right questions:\n You help others connect the dots instead of just giving them the solution.\n You drive alignment without forcing compliance.\n You create real buy-in—because people don’t argue with their own conclusions.\n\nGreat leaders don’t dictate.

But here’s how Weimo Liu turned a rescue pup’s adaptability into a $5M-funded graph revolution :\n\nWhat is PuppyGraph? \nPuppyGraph is the first graph query engine that lets you query existing relational data (SQL databases, data lakes, warehouses) as a graph in real-time — no ETL required. Unlike traditional graph databases that demand costly data migration, PuppyGraph adapts to your data’s natural habitat, unlocking insights without forcing it into \"graph-shaped boxes.\" (BusinessWire)\n\nThe PuppyGraph Breakthrough \nAs TigerGraph’s Engineering Lead (and ex-Google F1 Query Engine architect), Weimo Liu watched 72% of enterprise graph projects collapse under ETL complexity. Clients wasted months moving data, with one burning $2M on a fraud detection system that failed when pipelines collapsed.\n\nPuppyGraph was born: a zero-ETL engine that queries SQL databases (Snowflake, BigQuery), data lakes (Iceberg, Parquet), and warehouses directly. It’s now deployed by Coinbase, Clarivate, and Alchemy Pay to find hidden fraud patterns, optimize supply chains, and boost LLM accuracy by 40% (VentureBeat).\n\nWhy Leaders Care\n1️⃣ Speed Without Sacrifice:\nExecute 10-hop queries in 2.26 seconds across billions of edges (CelerData) — vs. weeks of ETL with legacy systems.\n2️⃣ Scalability Meets Simplicity:\nDeploy via Docker/Kubernetes in <10 minutes, scaling to petabytes. Ideal for real-time fraud detection (Coinbase) and supply chain optimization (Datanami).\n3️⃣ Cost Efficiency:\n$5M seed funding (Yahoo Finance) fuels tools that slash TCO by 60% vs. traditional graph databases.\n\nReal-World Impact\nClarivate’s Director of Data Science shares:\n“PuppyGraph let us query across data categories without migration — unlocking insights we’d missed for years.” (BusinessWire)\n\nValentine’s Week Leadership Challenge ️\n With your coffee, ask:\nWhat “doing things the same way mentality” limits my team’s agility?\nHow can fostering “puppy-like adaptability” unlock hidden data relationships?\n\nStay Tuned ️\nLater this week: My interview with Weimo Liu drops, covering:\n--> His journey from Google’s F1 team to PuppyGraph’s $5M seed round\n--> Why “zero-ETL” is the future of AI/ML infrastructure\n\n\n\n(Pic Mario with Weimo Liu and Danfeng Xu)",

I left my home country, restarted my career in a new place, and stepped into an industry where I had no official title—but plenty of transferable skills.\n\n I’ve been in rooms where I felt out of place.\n I’ve had to prove myself over and over again.\n I’ve questioned whether I was enough.\n\nSome days, I still do. But that’s the price of choosing growth over comfort.\n\nConfidence doesn’t come from external validation, it comes from recognizing what you’ve been capable of all along.\n\nAnd from asking yourself the right questions:\n\n What can I offer that’s unique?\n What challenges can only I solve with my experience?\n What stories can only I tell?\n\nEvery day, I remind myself:\n\n I am the one who put in the effort.\n I am the one who adapted, learned, and grew.\n I am the one who defines my own path.\n\n And if you’re doubting yourself right now, remember: You are the one too.\n\n️ Repost to inspire more people.",

        "content": "What is everyone talking about today? Super Bowl Ads.\n\n\n\nAnything crazy generates likes / clicks / eyeballs / advertisers. It's like moths getting attracted to a candle - they know that they will burn up but the light is just so enticing. They can't help themselves. It will be all over in under 48 hours.\n\nTaking a cue from other publications - I am going to use the TRENDING, HAS BEEN, and CHARLIE BROWN monikers to make it easy to understand.\n\nTRENDING:\nAI generated content. Why pay for expensive actors when you can hire a computer? As much as contracts stipulate that this needs to be controlled, I think companies will try ways to get more while paying less. I predict that the next Super Bowl will have at least one fully AI produced ad: from start to finish. Yes, there are some AI components in the current batch. I am predicting that there will be more. As in CMO will hire a fully AI video startup and it will spit out the commercial to the company which is airing the Super Bowl. There used to be a disclaimer \"no animals were harmed in the making of this commercial\". Soon there will be \"no humans were harmed nor involved with the making of this commercial\". There is potential for some amazing things.\n\n\nHAS BEEN:\nThere are so many different things I have heard and seen for this category. Here is a big one: very very very few people will change their thinking, consumption behavior, or literally anything else based upon a 30 second ad during the Super Bowl. Are you an Apple or Google person? 99.999% you will continue (until there is a very large reason not to). Do you drink Bud Lite or Millers Lite or Budweiser or any other alcohol? Unless you were in a situation where you could not get your \"preferred libation, you are very unlikely to try something else\". Even if a frog or a horse talks to you. And no I can not hear you now.\n\n\nCHARLIE BROWN:\nCompanies will continue to spend gobs of money to play the game of \"coocoo marketing\". Or some of you might recognize this as \"whack-a-mole\". The point is that the company disappears and then reappears randomly somewhere else (normally where the customers and employees least expect it to). Some companies use the Super Bowl as a \"coming out opportunity to introduce their brand to the public\". And then they disappear. Poof! It would have been better to hire a small agency to create a long term play to consistently get in front of their ideal customer (not just any Tom/Dick/Harry). Please see image of the Whack-A-Mole game. Go try to kick the ball, Charlie Brown - you are going to fall down and wonder where it went. And so the eyes and minds of the consumers will be on to the next thing and forget about you.",

She moves in uncertainty and the clarity follows.\n\n She trusts her decisions, moves fast, and creates momentum.\n\n She makes decisions based on what she wants, not just what she needs.\n\n She doesn’t wait for the “right time”. She knows overthinking is just procrastination disguised as logic.\n\n She circulates money with intention. Money is energy, and stagnant energy shrinks.\n\n She puts herself in the right spaces.

This habitual engagement in thought can prevent the dissolution of the mind’s fluctuations (vrittis), which Patanjali describes as the root of our suffering and distraction.\n\nIn essence, when faced with internal or external conflicts, the mind instinctively “talks” its way through the discomfort instead of “sitting with” the experience. This tendency is seen as an impediment to attaining the deep, unconditioned state of Calmness—a state of clarity and equanimity where the true self can be experienced without the filters of constant analysis.\n\nThe Yoga Sutras thus encourage practitioners to recognize and transcend this pattern. By developing practices such as meditation and detachment (vairagya), one learns to quiet the mind’s need to resolve every contradiction through thought, paving the way toward a more profound, unmediated awareness.",

By seamlessly blending beauty and fashion with food, they tap into sensory marketing, making their products feel as indulgent as a treat. Glossy textures mirror melted chocolate, soft hues resemble fresh pastries, and rich pigments take cues from decadent desserts.\n\nWhy does this work? Because taste and touch are deeply connected. Studies show that visual cues associated with food can trigger cravings and emotional responses, making products feel more desirable. When a lip gloss looks like fresh strawberry syrup or a handbag blends into a flaky croissant, it creates a subconscious association with indulgence and pleasure—making the product feel just as irresistible as the food itself.\n\nFrom Rhode’s buttery croissants to Jacquemus’ playful baguettes, brands are turning their products into visual feasts. This is more than just aesthetic—it’s a strategic play on psychology, nostalgia, and sensory appeal.\n\nWould you fall for it?",

        "content": "80% of jobs aren't advertised. \n\nIt's a tough market out there right now. Layoffs happen every single day, and there are hundreds if not thousands of applications for each job opening.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nit doesn't need to be, though.\n\nHere's how to position your LinkedIn profile like a landing page - and drive leads and recruiters into your DMs.\n\n1. Headline = Your Hook\nYour job title is not enough. Your headline should instantly communicate:\n\n- What you do\n- Who you help\n- Why you’re different\n\nExample: Sales Director - I've helped 3 B2B SaaS businesses grow ARR by 246% without increasing headcount.\n\n2. About Section = Your Sales Pitch.\nThis is not a resume summary—it’s your chance to sell yourself.\n\n- Speak directly to your ideal employer/client.\n- Showcase your wins. (data > adjectives.)\n- End with a clear CTA. Example: \"DM me if you’re a X looking for Y\"\n\n3. Featured Section = Your Portfolio\nThink of this as your proof of work.\n\n- Add case studies, projects, or media that showcase your expertise.\n- If you post regularly, pin your best-performing expert content here.\n\n4. Experience = Not Just Job Titles\nRecruiters skim. Don’t make them guess what you did.\n\n- Bullet point key achievements (with metrics).\n- Show results, not responsibilities.\n- Use power phrases like “Generated $2M in pipeline” instead of “Responsible for sales.”\n\n5. Engagement = Your SEO\nIf you’re not active, you’re invisible.\n\n- Comment on industry conversations.\n- Post valuable insights weekly.\n- Optimise your profile with keywords so recruiters and hiring managers can find you.\n\n6. Skills & Endorsements = Social Proof\nThere's a reason why Amazon has peer reviews. Leverage yours.\n\n- Get colleagues or past clients to endorse you—it boosts credibility.\n- If you have recommendations, pin the best ones to your profile.\n\n7. DM strangers.\nGreat a list of companies you want to work for. Find the hiring managers for the relevant department. Pull them into a list and DM them with the specifics of what you've done, your expertise and why you're interested in working for them. Ask if there's an opportunity to \"work together\" (not \"find a job\") and if not, who do they recommend you speak to?\n\nPeople want to help. Use them to get where you need to go.\n\nI break down how to write an A* LinkedIn Profile in the LinkedIn Playbook. Download it here:\n\nIt's not enough to be the best anymore, you have to be the best known.\n\nStop waiting to be found, and allow the right people to find you.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n",

        "content": "I am on a mission to eliminate the \"every 2-3 year big playbook build overhaul\"\n\nFor my sales reps out there...how many of you love this process? Think it actually moves the needle? Not seeing too many hands.\n\nWhy? Most sellers realize that they don't need the latest and greatest big thing, they know that only PARTS of the process need help and we can fix those in a quarter.\n\nHere are 3 reasons why everyone needs to move to quarterly optimization cycles and our clients are seeing the impact\n\n1. Generative AI is moving to fast. You have to constantly be updating your playbook, quarterly, to incorporate new use cases and content. This isn't about automating emails, it's automating things they are doing with Google today.\n\nMore GenAI productivity gains = more revenue faster\n\n2. Every sales team would go crazy if they knew that Enablement, Ops, Marketing, and Sales were meeting quarterly to make sure their roadmaps were aligned. Get everyone focused on solving the bottleneck faster.\n\nDeath of the silos = more revenue faster\n\n3. Buyer behavior is shifting too quickly. Nobody will put up with a qualification call in 2026-7. If your team is still not optimizing for speed in your customer journey, read my book, and set up processes to speed up customer knowledge and meet customers where they are faster.\n\nCustomized Sales Journeys = more revenue faster\n\nThe future is monthly and quarterly focused optimization.\n\nReach out if you know your team needs this and is ready to take the leap \n\nEpisode #18 is live on Youtube if you want to check out the full episode",

        "content": "Words Can Be a Weapon of Destruction \n\nWow, what a powerful headline. Throughout my lifetime, there have been two instances where words made a profound impact on me. Lessons in life is how I look at it.\n\nThe first instance was something my father shared with me repeatedly over the years. Even into my adulthood, while dropping off my son—his grandchild—for a summer visit, Dad would remind me, \"We are no better than anyone else, but we have a responsibility to lead by example.\" Being a Kurka meant carrying forward a legacy of integrity, respect, and humility. This upbringing taught me that every individual is unique and valuable, and that our differences should be celebrated, not used as a basis for division. It instilled in me a sense of duty to treat everyone with kindness and fairness, and to strive for excellence in all that I do, not for personal gain, but to honor the values passed down to me.\n\nThe second instance happened on Sunday, December 18, 2016. We had just lost our home of 21 years to an electrical fire on December 8, 2016. I had escaped the fire in my nightclothes and a bathrobe. My world was upside down and still very confused, but I returned to St. Stephens the Martyr with a grateful and thankful prayer. Upon entering, I heard two middle-aged female parishioners behind me exclaim, “OMG, she is wearing blue jeans to Mass. I would never embarrass myself and dishonor the Church.” She did not know that I was waiting for insurance money or that we had just moved into a hotel, I was canceling Xfinity, looking for a cell phone and service to replace what was lost. Cutting power, water and trying to just make it through the day.\n\nHer words cut through me like a knife. This woman, whom I did not know, nor did she know me, chose to label me in such a manner. It has been close to ten years, and her words are still destructive within my world.\n\nWhen my fingers fly across my keyboard, my singular goal is to be educational, enlightening, and a positive force in whatever I am writing about. And should you ever find my writing to be anything less, please call me out and give me a learning opportunity.\n\nSasha’s Urban Garden website is almost ready to go live in a few weeks. As mentioned before, I am now a nonprofit gardener who aims to resolve food insecurities within my community and help with mental wellbeing by providing fresh-cut flowers to anyone in need of something positive that day.\n\nNURTURE GROWTH – EMBRACE CHANGE & WELLBEING Join me in cultivating hope.",

        "content": "4 months ago, I was invisible on LinkedIn.\n\nNow I'm ranked #1 in my niche.\n\nGetting referrals, and helping leaders build their personal brands.\n\nFour months ago, I started my LinkedIn journey.\n\nI had no viral posts.\nNo big audience.\nNo perfect strategy.\n\nJust a goal: to build my personal brand and help others do the same.\n\nAt first, it felt like I was throwing words into the void.\n\nI’d post, engage, and show up and yet sometimes, it felt like no one was listening.\n\nI saw people growing faster.\nI saw polished profiles while I was still tweaking mine.\nI saw engagement that made mine look nonexistent.\n\nAnd for a moment, I wondered if am I even doing this right.\n\nBut then I remembered something:\n\nPersonal branding isn’t built overnight.\n\nSo I made a decision:\n\n I stopped chasing numbers and started focusing on impact.\n I stopped overthinking my niche and started speaking to the right people.\n I stopped waiting for the perfect strategy and started taking action.\n\nHere’s what worked for me (and might work for you too):\n\n1. Post with purpose, not pressure.\n→ A consistent schedule (even just 2–3x a week) builds momentum.\n\n2. Engagement builds visibility.\n→ Commenting and connecting matter just as much as posting.\n\n3. Clarity beats perfection.\n→ Your audience connects with authenticity, not polished perfection.\n\nFour months later, the results started showing up:\n\n- More visibility.\n- More meaningful connections.\n- More opportunities.\n- Referrals from people who trust my insights.\n- Helping leaders build their personal brand.\n- Ranked #1 in LinkedIn for Online Business & Solopreneurship (Favikon).\n\nNot because I went viral.\n\nNot because I had all the answers.\n\nBut because I stayed consistent when most people quit.\n\nNow, I help professionals and business owners do the same to build their online presence and lead effectively in both corporate and side ventures.\n\nIf you’re ready to grow your brand and leadership presence, let’s connect.\n\nAre you showing up for the long game? Let’s discuss in the comments!",

        "content": "The shortcut to massive personal growth isn't:\n\n• Taking ice baths\n• Meditating every day\n• \"Hacking\" your dopamine\n\nIt's writing.\n\nI've been writing every day for 10+ years.\n\nThese are the 5 unexpected ways writing daily has transformed my mind, actions, and life:\n\n1. Accountability.\n\nJournaling on a daily (or even weekly) basis allows you to:\n\n• Document your state of mind\n• Write (and rewrite) your goals\n• Compare what you write vs how you act\n• Learn to merge your inner desires with your outer world\n\nThere is no better accountability tool.\n\n2. Clarity of feelings.\n\nEveryone talks about how writing leads to clarity of thought.\n\nWhat doesn't get talked about is how writing leads to clarity of your emotions.\n\nWhen you force yourself to write how you feel, you peel back the layers—until you find the root of the root.\n\n3. Self-confidence.\n\nI was a very socially anxious, insecure teenager.\n\nAnd I was terrified of speaking up in class.\n\nBut when you write, you practice:\n\n• Your ideas\n• Your beliefs\n• Your convictions\n\nThe more you write, the better you get at articulating them.\n\n4. Natural voice.\n\nSo many writers stress over \"finding their voice.\"\n\nBut when you write & journal (a lot), your natural voice can't help but appear on the page in front of you.\n\nEven as I write this, I can \"hear\" how this voice is the same as my journal voice.\n\nIt's all me. You learn to trust yourself.\n\n5. Patience.\n\nWriting takes time because thinking takes time.\n\n• It's not about putting words on the page.\n• It's about stacking thoughts to form a perspective.\n\nWhen you can learn to be patient with yourself & your thoughts, it's much easier to be patient with others and theirs.",
