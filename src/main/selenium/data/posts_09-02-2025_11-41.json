Since then, my mother has been my world.\nI knew I had to step up, work hard, and give her the life she deserves.\n\nDon’t let others tell your definition of enjoyment. Everyone’s journey is unique, and your idea of joy might be different from theirs.\n\nI wish you all bring good fortune to your families and make your parents proud.\n\nGod is great ️",

        "content": "The Sunday Reset: Setting the Tone for the Week\n\n\nFor the longest time, Sundays felt like a weird in-between—too late to fix last week, too early to start the next.\n\nSome weeks, I’d ignore my to-do list and convince myself I deserved an entire day of rest. Other times, I’d try to cram in everything I neglected during the week, leaving me drained before Monday even began.\n\nThen I realized something: Sundays aren’t just for rest, and they aren’t just for productivity either. They’re for resetting.\n\nNow, I use Sundays to reflect, plan, and recharge. I check in with myself, tidy my space, set my priorities, and do something that fuels me.\n\nIt’s not about having the ‘perfect’ routine—it’s about finding balance so I don’t enter the new week feeling behind before it even starts.\n\nHow do you spend your Sundays?",

Guided by spiritual knowledge, we understand that, bigger than the visible material reality, no matter how grand it may seem, is the invisible spiritual reality. And in that spiritual realm reigns supreme the all-loving, all-attractive divinity, Krishna, the greatest well-wisher of all living beings.\n\nWe may conceptually understand God as the greatest reality in terms of the structure of things, yet we often forget that this truth applies not only to the structure but also to the workings of things. God is not a distant being, content in his supremacy and unconcerned with what happens elsewhere. Instead, he is active, working behind the scenes, moving the world and all living beings toward ultimate auspiciousness. As the Bhagavad-gita (9.10) declares, the Lord oversees the movements of material nature.",

This game allows users to guess a randomly selected word letter by letter. With a visually appealing design and interactive gameplay, it’s a great way to practice coding while enjoying a classic word-guessing game.\n\nKey Features:\n1) Random Word Selection: Picks a random word from a predefined list.\n2) Dynamic Display: Shows underscores for unguessed letters, and updates in real-time as the player makes correct guesses.\n3) Guess Tracking: Keeps track of guessed letters, with a limit on the number of incorrect guesses.\n4) Message Alerts: Provides feedback on each guess (correct, incorrect, or already guessed).\n5) Interactive UI: Built with Tkinter, featuring an intuitive layout with an input field for user guesses, chances left, and real-time game messages.\nGame Reset: Includes a button to restart the game once it's over.\n\nTools Used:\n1) Python\n2) Tkinter (GUI)\n\nThis project not only helped me improve my skills with Python but also gave me a deeper understanding of game logic, user interaction, and GUI design.\nAnd I would like to thank my mentor Gaurav sir for helping me and giving me a proper guidance on this project\nThank You\n,",

The geometry isn’t a clean descent; it’s a structured relaxation, shaped by constraints.\n\nDeepSeek’s optimization is an incremental refinement, but there’s still massive inefficiency—they’re sculpting the loss surface locally, not globally. The key isn’t just stacking more—it’s controlling how the energy propagates across layers to enforce structured generalization.\n\nAnd yes, a new double descent could emerge, but not in the usual sense. As these models refine self-verification mechanisms, we may see a second-phase generalization collapse and recovery, where sharper verification constraints momentarily degrade performance before stabilizing into a lower-energy manifold.\n\nThis isn’t just about model depth—it’s about curvature control, structured stacking, and guiding diffusion within the learning space.",

        "content": "Imagine walking into work one day and sensing an eerie quietness—fewer colleagues in meetings, budgets tightening, and whispered conversations behind closed doors. Are these signs of layoff?\n\nLayoffs are unsettling but often predictable if you know where to look.\n\nCompanies facing financial struggles or strategic shifts exhibit clear warning signs long before pink slips arrive.\n\n\nHere are a few red flags that you need to look out for\n\n1. Hiring and Spending Freezes: The First Alarm Bell\nWhen a company stops hiring or freezes discretionary spending (delay major investments), it signals financial uncertainty or a shift in priorities.\n\nThis preventive approach allows companies to control costs without immediately resorting to layoffs. However, if the situation worsens, a hiring freeze is often the precursor to more drastic cuts.\n\n\n2. Executive Departures and Internal Restructuring\nWhen key executives exit or teams undergo sudden reorganization, it often signals instability, internal disagreements about the company’s direction and impending workforce reductions.\n\nSimultaneously, restructuring efforts designed to “streamline operations” may disguise downsizing efforts.\n\nExecutive changes often precede layoffs, as new leadership may implement cost-cutting strategies that impact headcount.\n\nIf leadership changes and restructuring weren’t enough, employees should pay special attention to company-wide meetings that appear out of nowhere.\n\n\n3. The Dreaded Company-Wide Meeting: An Ominous Sign\nAn unexpected, urgent all-hands meeting often precedes major announcements—frequently layoffs or restructuring plans.\n\nHistory has shown that sudden company-wide meetings, especially those led by top executives, rarely bring good news. Employees are often briefed on “new directions,” “tough decisions,” or “necessary adjustments”—all coded language for impending job losses.\n\nThese meetings usually serve as the final step before layoffs are announced, confirming suspicions raised by hiring freezes, executive departures, and restructuring. If such a meeting is scheduled, employees should prepare their résumés and explore contingency plans.\n\n\nUnderstanding these signals can help employees act proactively rather than being caught off guard when layoffs become a reality.While layoffs may seem sudden, they are often preceded by unmistakable warning signs.\n\nEmployees should remain alert to hiring and spending freezes, executive exits, internal restructuring, and unexpected company-wide meetings. Each of these signals offers an opportunity to prepare, whether through upskilling, job searching, or networking.\n\nRather than waiting for bad news, professionals should stay vigilant, read between the lines, and take control of their career trajectory before layoffs become a reality.",

Adjust your privacy settings so only trusted individuals can access sensitive details. For example, limit profile visibility to “Connections Only” for added security.\n\n Tip 2: Be Selective with Endorsements and Recommendations\nOnly accept endorsements and recommendations from people you’ve worked with directly. This ensures your profile remains credible and avoids association with potentially fake or untrustworthy accounts.\n\n Tip 3: Verify Job Offers and Recruiters\nBefore responding to job offers or recruiter messages, research the company and individual. Check their LinkedIn activity, shared connections, and online presence to confirm legitimacy. Scammers often pose as recruiters to collect personal information.\n\n Tip 4: Avoid Sharing Sensitive Work Details\nRefrain from posting confidential company information, project specifics, or proprietary data on your profile or in updates. This protects both your employer and your professional reputation.\n\n Tip 5: Regularly Audit Your Connections\nPeriodically review your LinkedIn connections and remove any that seem suspicious or irrelevant. Keeping a curated network helps maintain the quality of your professional relationships.\n\n Tip 6: Monitor Login Activity\nUse LinkedIn’s tools to check recent login activity on your account. If you notice logins from unfamiliar locations or devices, update your password immediately and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).\n\n Tip 7: Be Wary of Suspicious Messages\nIf someone sends you a message asking for personal information or offering unrealistic opportunities, proceed with caution. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments unless you’re confident they’re safe.\n\n Tip 8: Stay Updated on Security Practices\nRegularly review LinkedIn’s security resources to stay informed about new features or potential threats. Being proactive about learning best practices keeps you one step ahead of cyber risks.\n\n Tip 9: Limit Third-Party App Access\nCheck which apps are connected to your LinkedIn account and revoke access for any that are unnecessary or unfamiliar. This reduces the risk of unauthorized data sharing.\n\n Tip 10: Report Suspicious Profiles or Activity\nIf you encounter fake profiles, phishing attempts, or inappropriate behavior, report them to LinkedIn immediately. Your actions can help protect others in the community from similar risks.\n\n Follow me for more tips on staying secure online!\n\n Share this post to help others protect their LinkedIn profiles and professional identity!\n\nWant more great AI tips and news?

Despite repeated attempts to resolve this matter since December 3, 2024, there has been no satisfactory resolution, refund, or replacement.\nKey Details:\nIssue Reported:\nPersistent \"No Signal\" error related to the TV setup box and HDMI connectivity.\nA service request was raised, but the technician failed to provide a job sheet/service note, as mandated.\nPrevious Communication:\nFlipkart’s support team (case ref: IN24120319310149528604) requested a job sheet or service denial proof (email dated December 16, 2024). However, the technician did not furnish this document, making compliance impossible.\nMultiple follow-ups (December 3, 2024, and December 16, 2024) have yielded no resolution, replacement, or refund.\nCurrent Status:\nThe product remains non-functional, and the lack of accountability has left me deeply dissatisfied.\nI am compelled to consider legal recourse if this issue is not resolved immediately.\nRequested Action:\nImmediate refund of the payment OR\nReplacement with a fully functional unit.\nI have attached screenshots of all prior communications for your reference.

I don't know if it will have the same effect on you but I'll let you decide.\n\n\nAs we embarked into our daily journey into the Word, I found myself explaining Psalm 3:3 to my children.\n\n\nFor thou, oh Lord, art a shield for me. You are my glory and the lifter of my head. \n\n\nImagine me having to explain that David wrote this when he was running away from his son Absalom who was trying to kill him and take the throne - talk about wahala pro max...\n\n\nBut that not the humbling part. This is \n\n\nImagine a soldier without a shield in the heat of the battle  That soldier is going to be hit soon!\n\n\nA shield is a protective gear in warfare. David said that's who God is to him.\n\n\nUnlike every other gear, a shield (and a sword) are two gears you have to be intentional in carrying and positioning.\n\n\nSometimes, the shield looks like a burden that many soldiers abandon it in the heat of battle. Some soldiers, Like Goliath of Gath, even employ others to carry it for them - remember how he ended up.\n\n\n This week, will you be intentional about putting God in His position in your life?\n\n\n Are you so busy in the midst of the battle that you have placed your shield aside and you are now fighting bare chested? This is where many Christian are. They believe God, they profess love but their hearts are far from him!\n\n\n Have you employed others to carry your shield for you - Relying on only the Sunday sermon and content creators to feed you - but no real personal and consistent relationship with God?\n\n\nPS: Before I go, let me take it a notch deeper. This shield is our faith with which we quench the fiery darts of the devil.\n\n\nOur faith is noth just a general idea of the existence of God. Rather, it is the position of our heart in the relevance of God as tackle our daily situations.\n\n\nWhen you really believe that He exists and His word is true and infallible, you express it in the way you tackle doubts, fear, worry, challenges etc. Do you allow these darts penetrate or do you use your shield?\n\n\nIt is also evident in how you treat your successes. It's sometimes easy to turn to God in the midst of challenges and forget all about Him when things run smoothly Selah.\n\n\nPS: Did you learn something? Share with me in comments.\n\n==============================\n\n\nIs knowing more about God and your purpose here on earth a priority for you in 2025?\n\n\nJoin me @and I will hold your hands as you grow in your knowledge of God.",

However, we humbly acknowledge that we did not secure the position this time. However, we view this outcome as a stepping stone towards growth and improvement.\n\nMy first hackathon with my team(,,,) was an absolute whirlwind of an experience. From the initial brainstorming sessions, fueled by copious amounts of caffeine and snacks, to the late-night coding sprints, the energy was infectious. We faced our fair share of challenges, from debugging nightmares to moments where we thought our project was doomed, but we tackled each obstacle together. The camaraderie and support within the team were incredible; everyone brought their unique skills to the table, and we learned so much from each other along the way. While sleep was a distant memory and the pressure was on, the thrill of creating something from scratch in such a short timeframe was exhilarating. Seeing our project come to life, even in its prototype form, was incredibly rewarding, and the sense of accomplishment we shared as a team made all the late nights and frantic coding totally worth it. I'm already looking forward to the next hackathon and the opportunity to build and learn even more with this amazing team.\n\nWe also got the opportunity to meet the guest speaker of that eventandand get motive by their speaks.They share their great experience with us.\n\nWe sincerely thank theandfor hosting this fantastic hackathon. It was an invaluable experience, providing us with a platform to collaborate, innovate, and learn. We appreciate the university's commitment to fostering a strong tech community and providing the resources that made this event a success. Thank you for investing in our future.",

The technological shift to a Product Knowledge Graph changes the game—bringing a new paradigm for structuring, linking, and leveraging product data across the enterprise.\n\n Why PLM Has Failed on Product Data:\n Data silos: PLM systems lock data inside rigid structures, making integration difficult.\n Poor accessibility: Engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain teams struggle to access the right data when they need it.\n Complexity overload: Monolithic PLM implementations become bloated, costly, and hard to maintain.\n Lack of flexibility: PLM struggles to adapt to modern data models, digital threads, and AI-driven insights.\n Disconnected workflows: PLM often fails to bridge the gap between design, procurement, and production.\n\nThe Product Knowledge Graph offers a new paradigm—structuring, linking, and leveraging product data across the enterprise for better decision-making and efficiency.\n\nHow can your organization finally get the product data it needs?\n\nRead more:  Helping Your Organization Get Product Data [link in the comment]",

When you have been active in PLM for over 20 years, you can observe that PLM delivers the expected support for product data to many customers.\n\nWhere people have the feeling that PLM has failed, it was more often due to over-hyped expectations (remember the Autodesk statement below - PLM in 2 weeks)\n\nPLM will never fail if the expectations are right - of course, as a PLM software vendor, you must have higher expectations; otherwise, there would be no progress in what is possible.

        "content": "Incky is coming to life!\n\nYou ever get a pet and just know its name before you even meet it? Like, “I’m getting a dog, and his name is going to be Bob.” Boom. Bob. No negotiation. The dog could be a prissy little Pomeranian or a deranged mutt with an eye patch and a questionable past, but no matter what, Bob it is.\n\nI’m not that person.\n\nNo, when I get a new pet, there’s an awkward period of name limbo. I watch them. I take note. Is this a “Mittens” situation, or am I dealing with a “Captain Poops-A-Lot”? These things require observation. Because until I know who they are, I can’t possibly know what to call them.\n\nTurns out, building a business—our business—is a lot like that. We started with a vague sense of mission, a dream, and a logo ripped straight from the digital ether. Like a newborn cryptid, our brand was a little squishy, a little undefined, a little we’ll-figure-it-out-as-we-go.\n\nAnd then, Incky happened.\n\nAt first, he was just a placeholder. A robot doodle pulled from Canva that looked suspiciously like a PlayStation mascot who might sue us in a dark alley. But when&designed our logo—oh man, that was the moment.\n\nThat was the lightning-strikes-the-monster moment.\n\nIncky became.\n\nA digital being who could inhabit any device, appear on any screen, traverse the wild and weird world of tech with boundless curiosity. Joyful in discovery. Solving puzzles like a tiny, heroic cyber-sleuth. A little guy, an underdog, but let’s be clear—he may be small, but he is f*cking fierce.\n\nAnd that?\n\nThat’s us.\n\nThat’s.",

The format and spacing is identical, the sentence structures are similar, with emoji placements in the same places.

        "content": "BIOMIMICRY CONTINUUM – Part 5 – CURATING Agentic Expertise\nMultidisciplinary expertise is critical to correctly define the key premises driving problem analysis and solution architecture, and the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem (left image) enables capturing that expertise as a reusable computing asset.\n\nThe current AI chaos is due to 70 years of narrow and unexamined premises. The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

Do you choose to start with an adventure or breakfast today?”\n\nSome days, we read about how Sinner has become a great tennis player.\nOthers, we raid the kitchen to make pancakes for the family.\n\nThe coaching lesson hiding in our castle chaos:\nResistance often comes from unmet needs, not defiance.\n\nHe doesn’t need help climbing down.\nHe needs connection before the day swept us apart.\n\n3 mindset shifts that transformed our mornings (and my leadership):\n\n1️⃣ Think about “demands” as invitations\n“He’s depending on me again” becomes “He’s trusting me with his first moments.”\n\n2️⃣ Stop being efficient, be present\nInstead of rushing through the morning, we slow down to connect. A five-minute conversation beats five extra minutes of sleep any day.\n\n3️⃣ Let them express themselves\nHis pancakes may look like a burnt snowman. We high-five it anyway.\n\nThis weekend, try this:\n1. Ask: “What’s the ‘castle bed’ moment I’ve been resisting?”\n(A repetitive task? A relationship friction?)\n2. Change the script: “How could this become a connection ritual instead?”\n\nAssays:\n“Leadership is not about being in charge. It’s about taking care of those in your charge.”\n\nBefore you climb any ladder today, remember that it’s all about building meaningful connections.\n\n——\n️ Repost this to help your network grow on leadership.\nAnd followto read more.",

Be the type of person who reaches out to others... when you don't need something.\n\n3. The greatest muscle you can build is urgency.\n\n4. Most successful people move with this mindset: Entitled to nothing, willing to earn everything.\n\n5. Pray like it's up to God. Work like it's up to you.\n\n6. You don't need more time, you need a deadline.\n\n7. The success you are looking for is waiting for you in the work you are currently avoiding.\n\n8. Biographies of billionaires teach you more than self-help books.\n\n9. Your lack of focus will kill you before your competitors ever get a chance.\n\n10. Winning isn't an accident, it's earned.\n\n11. Underrated superpower: Just dumb enough to believe in yourself, just smart enough to execute.\n\n12. Complexity makes you seem smart. Simplicity makes you money.\n\n13. Surround yourself with owners, the conversation is just different.\n\n14. The more you learn about money, the more you realize most of us play with Legos while the really rich play chess.\n\n15. Beginners do too much. Pros do only what's needed.\n\n16. Underperformers want ease. Midperformers want credit. Winners want pressure.\n\n17. Your most expensive mistake will be a \"who,\" not a \"what.\"\n\n18.

He built an AI SDR. \n\n\n\nIt’s not that the technology piece won’t work… it will.\n\nThe limitation of building an AI SDR is the psychology of the prospect, not the technology of the sender.\n\nRemember when Hi {{first_name}} skyrocketed open rate from 35% to over 70%!?\n\nYou know what the effect is of {{first_name}} today? Negligible.\n\nThe same applies to job changes, and fundraising. Those strategies are dying! Why?\n\nBecause the first people who did it, it was unique, it was cool! Made the prospect feel good!\n\nNow you change jobs and 163 companies email you about it.\n\nNow you raise funds and 2849 companies email you about it.\n\nThe prospect simply thinks “this is so annoying”\n\nReplies might stay high, but they’re more like “no thanks” and “go away” than “impressive email, let’s chat”\n\nNow think about it. Sam Altman created the newest AI SDR, adoption to the moon!\n\nIt’ll likely do the above strategies and more. It means all prospects will now be more quickly annoyed even at VERY PERSONALIZED things.\n\nEmail is DEAD, mostly because AI SDRs can’t make phone calls.\n\nWhatever Sam Altman can automate, it will desensitize in the market.\n\nIt’s a hamster wheel, not a race to a finish line. You can run faster and you’re ahead, but just for a bit before the wheel is now turning faster too.\n\nThe only way to win with Executives and Leaders is to do what the AI can’t do.\n\nNow stop here…. Think for a second, and test out the AI SDR… then go do all the things that it can’t do. That’s where your competitive advantage lies.\n\nHave fun!",

But I agree with the set up. \n\nI think there's more going on inside many mid to large organizations. (I don't engage with SMB so my lens may not be relevant if you sell to smaller companies and you have an extremely vertical/narrow product).\n\nCurrently, businesses are thoroughly investigating new technologies; while some may have available budgets, a significant portion is directed toward research and development for generative AI. Many are reluctant to invest in technology as they fear it may become outdated or don't want to risk additional investments if a major breakthrough in generative AI occurs.\n\nThere's considerable fear of missing out on the advancements in generative AI, leading companies to rush in before determining their investment strategies. This creates a unique clash between a stagnant market and the exciting developments in generative AI. However, companies like Outreach and Gong, among others, are effectively integrating AI into their existing workflows, making their products more appealing.",

Instead of killing the entire email channel, ESPs could also work with companies to charge senders for each email sent (it would be a small amount). Seems unlikely though.\n\nThis would drastically reduce the amount of spam and force senders to think twice about their campaigns. Even clay experts will be forced to up the quality of their outreach because they’ll be paying extra.\n\nCoinbase CEO had this to say about it:\n\n“If you had fast, cheap and global payments, what might that allow people to do? Maybe, sometimes on social media, people click the like button or they upvote/upload something. You know, why can’t that be a small transaction? Right? Today in the US, people get paid every two weeks for their paycheck. Why shouldn’t you get paid every hour? Maybe this whole idea of payday lending could go away.”",

The answer: about 10 minutes and yes.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nThe agent analyzes my past LinkedIn posts with high engagement to learn my writing style, topics, and patterns. It looks at things like:\n- Post structure and formatting\n- Common phrases and language\n- Topics that resonate with my audience\n- What drives comments and reactions\n\nThen when I give it a content idea, it drafts a post that matches my natural writing voice while incorporating what's worked well for me historically.\n\nLet me know if you're interested in checking it out and I'll make a quick template and demo video.\n\np.s. other than the intro, this post was written (with very light editing) by this AI agent\n\nEdit: there's a bit of a fun debate going on in the comments:\n- Most people think this is a cool idea and want to try it\n- A few think this is some combination of evil and lazy\n\nHere's how I think about it:\n\nFrom my POV, AI-assisted writing is pretty similar to something we've all done for many years:\n- we have an idea\n- we give the idea to someone on our team or a contractor to create a first draft\n- we take that draft and edit it until it we're happy with it\n\nIf the initial idea and the final presentation aren't human and compelling, then the outcome will be the AI slop we've all seen. But if they are, you can get to high quality output way faster :)\n\nWe all just now have the luxury of a teammate that's really good and really fast!",

Instead of resisting, I ask: How can this make me better?\n Collaborate & Communicate\nOpen dialogue within the team often leads to creative, unexpected solutions. I’ve seen how diverse perspectives create stronger outcomes.\n Innovate or Stagnate\nAdaptation is the secret sauce.

The more adaptable we are, the more resilient we become.\n Strategic Pivots Can Lead to Breakthroughs\nWhen faced with obstacles, agility has been my best friend.

Who needs your expertise?\n• Prioritize decision-makers – Don’t just connect with peers; go after buyers.\n• Engage with top voices in your industry – This gets you seen by their audience.\n\n Start here and avoid wasting time on random connections.\n\n𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: Don’t Stop at 50 Requests—It’s a Numbers Game\nNow you have two options:\n\n• Send a few requests and wait for magic to happen\n• Go big, track responses, and refine your outreach\n\nThere’s no wrong answer, but if you’re serious about growing, you need volume + strategy.\n\n 100+ connection requests per week\n 30%+ acceptance rate = you’re on the right track\n Keep tweaking your message for better results\n\nNetworking is a game of persistence.\n\n𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: Connect, But Go Beyond 'Thanks for Connecting'\nFocus on two core pillars:\n\n1. Your First Message Matters\n• Skip generic intros—lead with value\n• Ask an engaging question to spark a real convo\n• Find common ground fast (industry, mutual interests)\n\nOnce you master this, focus on:\n\n2. The Follow-Up Formula\n• 80% of deals come AFTER the 3rd+ follow-up\n• Keep it casual but intentional (not salesy)\n• Offer useful insights, not just “Hey, checking in”\n\nMost people stop at one message. You shouldn’t.\n\n𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: Build Social Proof While You Network\nMistake: Talking about yourself too much.\n\nEasy fix: Use content to back up your credibility while you network.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n• Post insights from your conversations (without naming names)\n• Share behind-the-scenes of working with clients\n• Showcase what you’re learning + how it helps others\n\nYour profile should do the selling for you.\n\n𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱: Make LinkedIn Work for You 24/7\n\nThis final step is how you:\n\n• Turn cold outreach into warm inbound leads\n• Position yourself as an authority\n• Build relationships that lead to high-value opportunities\n\n Want more deep-dive insights on LinkedIn networking & lead-gen?\n\nI’m sharing exclusive strategies in my newsletter today.

You skip this and jump to auto-discounting in a desperate attempt to close and it is a recipe for disaster especially if you cannot subsequently find out what your prospects budget is - you basically end up:\n\na) massively undercutting yourself in the process without realising (which is why we ask for the budget at the front end along with a bunch of other questions regarding when you do you need the physical product by etc. etc.) Ie. you clinch the deal at £20k when in reality due to the critical nature of the product you could have bagged say £40-50k (engineering is different to tech. but same principles apply here).\n\nb) Wasting precious time for all parties with no clear target / end result as even with further discounting your prospect has already decided to proceed with a competitor but will gladly use your discount to negotiate down the other party. In any case no deal and you lost time!\n\nc) Fixating on the wrong thing. Price is price but maybe you have to switch things up and look at alternative ways to proceed.\n\nBOSS move: If not right having discussed it further then agree to walk away as it's not achievable right now but you keep tabs - huge respect!",

These intelligent systems, capable of performing tasks traditionally handled by humans, will significantly enhance productivity and efficiency. \n\n But what exactly are AI agents?  These autonomous systems can make decisions and perform tasks based on their environment and inputs, operating intelligently without constant human intervention.  Imagine a world where AI agents can autonomously conduct research, design experiments, make reservations, or even order groceries. ️\n\n This marks a critical shift from current AI systems, which are limited to narrow tasks like chatbots or machine learning models. ️ Altman's vision extends even further into the realm of superintelligence, aiming to develop tools that sound like science fiction to many. \n\n The comments from Altman and other industry leaders come amid a continuous focus on AI-driven innovations. For instance,, founder of, highlighted in his 2025 predictions that AI agents are poised to revolutionize the crypto industry.  In October,launched an AI tool called Based Agent, allowing users to create AI agents independently. \n\n Multiple examples showcase AI agents being used for real-world purposes:\nBlockchain startup Story Protocol recently hired a Virtual Protocol AI Agent, Luna, to run its X account, making it the first of its kind to take over an X account for a daily payment of $1,000. \n\n Blockchain platform Axal introduced AI Agent Gekko with its autopilot feature, showcasing the potential of AI agents to handle complex tasks seamlessly. \n\n These advancements illustrate the potential of AI agents to revolutionize various industries, from blockchain to everyday business operations. The future of AI is here, and it's shaping up to be extraordinary! ",

Nikhil Kamathcio was a gracious host and we were having a great time. The problem was that the room we were in circulated outside air which made the air purifier I'd brought with me ineffective.\n\nInside, the AQI was 130 and PM2.5 was 75 µg/m³, which is equal to smoking 3.4 cigarettes for 24 hours of exposure.\n\nThis was my third day in India and the air pollution had made my skin break out in rash and my eyes and throat burn.\n\nAir pollution has been so normalized in India that no one even notices anymore despite the science of its negative effects being well known. People would be outside running. Babies and small children exposed from birth. No one wore a mask which can significantly decrease exposure. It was so confusing.\n\nThe evidence shows that India would improve the health of its population more by cleaning up air quality than by curing all cancers.\n\nI am unsure why India's leaders do not make air quality a national emergency. I don't know what interests, money and power keep things the way they are but it's really bad for the entire country.\n\nWhen I returned to the U.S., my eyes were fresh to see what is normalized to me. I saw obesity everywhere. 42.4% of American are obese and because I was around it all the time, I had been mostly oblivious to it.\n\nIn many contexts, obesity is worse than air pollution in the long term.\n\nWhy wouldn't American leaders declare a national emergency on obesity? What interests, money and power keep things the way they are but are really bad for the entire country.",

Why can't people use the public transport system? The government should make a law allowing no more than two vehicles per household and implement incentives for people using green transportation systems like EV vehicles and bicycles.\nUnnecessary construction: In the name of development, many contractors deconstruct and then reconstruct the same tar roads year after year to make money. Why not just build cement roads once and for all?\nThere should be standard pollution control levels at every construction site (both government and private). If pollution levels exceed hazardous limits, there should be a penalty.\nGreen eco parks should be created every 10 kilometers in metro cities. It should be mandatory for any new building project in metro cities to include a park.\nThe government should set a deadline for providing a free vehicle exchange policy for old vehicles, with the option to switch to EV vehicles with minimal additional cost.\nOne biogas plant should be established in every 10 villages to manage agricultural waste.\nOrganic waste management should be implemented at every industrial plant.",

From job interviews to casual conversations, there's often pressure to appear knowledgeable and competent. But what if I told you that one of the most powerful phrases you can use is \"I don't know\"?\nThink about it. Admitting you don't know something isn't a sign of weakness; it's a sign of strength. It demonstrates:\nHumility: Acknowledging the limits of your knowledge shows self-awareness and a willingness to learn. It makes you more approachable and relatable.\nOpenness to Learning: Saying \"I don't know\" opens the door to discovery. It invites others to share their expertise, creating opportunities for collaboration and growth.\nHonesty and Integrity: It's far more damaging to pretend you know something when you don't. Honesty builds trust, and trust is essential in any relationship, personal or professional.\nOpportunity for Growth: \"I don't know\" is the first step on the path to learning. It prompts you to seek out information, ask questions, and expand your understanding.\nSo, the next time you're faced with a question you can't answer, don't be afraid to say those three little words. You might be surprised at the positive impact they have. Embrace the unknown, and watch your knowledge and confidence grow.\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Share your experiences in the comments!",
