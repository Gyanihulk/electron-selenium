As organizations race to adopt\nand modern technologies, many find themselves navigating both triumphs and tribulations. According to Gartner, three of the top six challenges with digital transformation revolve around organizational structures, culture, and leadership capabilities. At, we‚Äôve seen the remarkable potential of\n, and we‚Äôve also seen the costly mistakes businesses make when implementing it. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here to share the best practices to drive successful transformation, alongside the painful pitfalls to avoid.\n\n1. Empower People, Address Their Fears\nYour people are your greatest allies in transformation. Help them embrace change by addressing their concerns about AI replacing jobs, disrupting control, or altering workflows. Empowered employees drive innovation.\n\n2. Start Small, Fail Fast, Learn Faster\nBreak large projects into manageable six-month models to test and adapt quickly. This approach minimizes risk, controls costs, and ensures you‚Äôre consistently delivering value.\n\n3. Prioritize Data Management\nData is the backbone of AI. Start by acknowledging its current state, no matter how messy, and implement strategies to clean and manage it. Strong data practices lead to stronger AI outcomes.\n\n4. Balance Build, Buy, and Fine-Tune Approaches\nAvoid over-relying on one strategy. A balanced approach, such as 30% buy, 40% fine-tune, and 30% build, provides flexibility and aligns solutions to your needs.\n\n5. Think of Transformation as a Marathon\nAI transformation is a long-term commitment. Set realistic expectations, pace your initiatives, and prepare for continuous evolution.\n\n6. Measure Progress and Outcomes\n\"If you want it, measure it. If you can‚Äôt measure it, forget it.\" Consistent evaluation ensures your AI investments are driving measurable results.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\nNeglecting the physical world in AI transformation overlooks its impact on offline operations like manufacturing and logistics, while over-relying on external companies compromises ownership and strategic control. Resistance to changing business models limits AI's potential to innovate processes and customer experiences. Adding AI as a patch rather than integrating it holistically can harm customer trust, and restricting AI to IT departments prevents its full potential as a cross-functional business enabler.\n\nAt, we‚Äôre passionate about helping businesses embrace AI and avoid the missteps that hinder progress. Let‚Äôs transform the future, together.",

They ensure that programs still work smoothly even if the underlying tables are no longer in use.\n\nRefresh & Regeneration \nSometimes, the data in these CDS views needs to be refreshed, ensuring that the program functions correctly. This process is typically done once after implementing your new SAP S/4 HANA system.\n\n3.Initial System Setup Ô∏è\nSAP recommends running this regeneration process during the first setup of your S/4 HANA system to refresh all obsolete tables converted to CDS views.\n\n4.Custom Fields Integration Ô∏è\nCDS views are also essential when adding custom fields through ABAP, enabling enhanced functionality in your system.\n\nBy using CDS views, SAP ensures smooth integration and performance with your legacy data while leveraging new functionalities.",
