      "content": "I tried to get to New Orleans last week. I really did.\n\nI wanted to attend the Pavilion CEO Summit in person, but like 90% of attendees, I didn't make it.\n\nNew Orleans isn‚Äôt equipped to handle 10‚Äù of snow. So, the event went virtual. And I still learned.\n\nSome of the data presented was more troubling than the weather.\n\n1). The revenue growth rate for SaaS business has been cut in half since the summer of 2021.\n2). SaaS go-to-market efficiency is on the decline.\n3). Top SaaS stocks are surging, but start-ups face more significant challenges.\n4). Down rounds are ‚Äúback on the menu.‚Äù\n5). In 2024, more startups closed than in the previous four years (2020 to 2023).\n\nBut there was good news.\n\n1). The worst of layoffs are thought to be behind us.\n2). The number of down rounds is declining.\n3). VC deal volume is still well below years prior but showing signs of rebound.\n4). Startup M&A is nearing record highs.\n5). Profitable, efficient growth is the new normal.\n\nAnd, if you haven‚Äôt heard, AI is a pretty big deal.\n\nOverall, I left the event feeling bullish.\n\nThe path to startup success in SaaS is more challenging than it used to be.\n\nBut the storm is ending. The signs are everywhere.\n\nHeck, it is going to be 65 degrees in New Orleans today.\n\nAnd I will be signing up to attend again next year. The CEO Summit is my favorite event of the year.",

      "content": "There‚Äôs a saying that relates mostly to betting or investments to not ‚Äúchase your losses‚Äù. Ô∏è I used to watch my elderly mom do that at the casino, convinced a higher bet would get her money back. It rarely worked out.\n\nBut, I‚Äôve had to learn this concept in business too.\n\nCase in point, I ignored my gut and bought that service I knew I wasn‚Äôt ready for. It was a significant investment, a stretch for where I was, and I should not have done it. Deep down I knew.\n\nAnd as a business owner or entrepreneur, you will make some decisions that don‚Äôt pan out how you thought. Or are no longer serving you. Sometimes they are just wrong. Shiny objects and slick sales tactics will get you to believe you need saving and that they will make your business dreams come true. Ô∏è\n\nIf you made the same mistake I have, learn from it and move on. Nothing is bringing that money back. Don‚Äôt keep chasing losses.\n\nThe real lesson is that you know. Trust yourself. Listen to your gut and move quickly if you‚Äôve made a mistake. Don‚Äôt pay monthly fees for something that is not for you or not working!\n\nWhether that is a software, vendor or consultant. Stop Chasing Losses! ",

I had the privilege of showcasing Yavi and demonstrating how our platform accelerates Gen AI-driven business and domain solutions and unlocks unparalleled value for enterprises.\n\nAnother highlight was joining the panel on No-Code platforms and tools, where I shared my thoughts on how to shape the future of this space.\n\nHere are my key takeaways from the conference:\n1. The GenAI opportunity is NOW‚Äîfocus on 10X impact and disruptive innovation.\n2. With LLMs and infrastructure ecosystems stabilizing, the focus should shift to domain-specific, ROI-driven applications.\n3. Build SaaS solutions for agents, empowering workflows and automation beyond just human users.\n\nA huge thank you to the GITPRO organizers and volunteers for creating such a vibrant and engaging platform for collaboration. Events like these fuel innovation and inspire us to build a brighter future with technology.",

Be specific about what success looks like and communicate it often to keep everyone focused on long-term goals.\n\n2. Learn to Say No\n\nNot every opportunity is worth pursuing. Prioritize tasks and projects that align with your core mission. Saying no to distractions allows you to stay efficient and focused on growth.\n\n3. Build Relationships, Not Transactions\n\nInvest time in creating genuine connections with customers, partners, and investors. People are more likely to support you if they feel valued and understand your mission deeply.\n\n4. Be Data-Driven, but Stay Intuitive\n\nUse metrics to guide your decisions, but trust your instincts when the numbers don‚Äôt tell the whole story. Balancing logic with intuition is key to spotting hidden opportunities.\n\n\nFound this helpful? Share with your network and let‚Äôs grow together!",

      "content": "Why Value Matters More Than Time\nYears spent in a position or a company might reflect experience, but they don‚Äôt automatically equate to growth. Growth stems from:\n\nImpact: Have your actions made a tangible difference?\nAdaptability: Are you learning and evolving with changing times?\nInnovation: Are you bringing fresh ideas and solutions to the challenges at hand?\n\nThe Myth of Tenure\nStaying in the same place for years might provide stability, but it doesn‚Äôt guarantee progress. A stagnant role can lead to complacency, where you mistake time for growth. True progress comes from pushing boundaries, taking risks, and stepping out of your comfort zone.\n\nWays to Focus on Value-Driven Growth\nPrioritize Impact: Look for ways to contribute meaningfully. Measure your success by the difference you make, not the time you‚Äôve spent.\n\nSeek Continuous Learning: Growth is rooted in learning new skills, adapting to change, and challenging yourself.\nEmbrace Change: Don‚Äôt hesitate to explore new roles, industries, or opportunities if they allow you to add value and grow.\n\nRemember:\nGrowth is a journey measured by progress, impact, and contributions‚Äînot by the clock. Instead of asking, ‚ÄúHow long have I been here?‚Äù, ask, ‚ÄúWhat have I accomplished, and how have I made a difference?‚Äù\n\nCreate, innovate, and add value every step of the way. Your legacy isn‚Äôt tied to longevity; it‚Äôs tied to significance. \n\n",

Just what I needed in life \n\nSaid no one EVER !\n\nI swear to god if I got a dollar for everytime I heard ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll circle back on this‚Äù I‚Äôd have enough money to fund my own manufacturing empire. CRAZY right? \n\nDon‚Äôt you guys think that closing a manufacturing deal is like solving a rubiks cube while being on a roller coaster? \n\nYou gotta navigate multiple stakeholders with different priorities, sales cycle dragging on a plot twist in a bad soap opera   and the communication gaps that makes you wonder whether you are speaking some kind of alien language which is different from everyone else .\n\nNow I‚Äôve been stuck in the trenches too and I have learnt a few things that has helped me survive this madness.\n\nAllow me to jot that down for you: \n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Forget your product specs‚Äîmanufacturers care about downtime, inefficiencies, and cutting costs. Focus on solving THEIR problems.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ You‚Äôre not talking to one person. You‚Äôre talking to a team of conflicting interests. Speak CFO, engineer, and even \"back-in-my-day\" nostalgia if you have to\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Most deals die at the ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll think about it phase‚Äù. Create urgency, but don‚Äôt pull the sleazy \"buy now\" stunt. Link your solution to what THEY care about like meeting goals or keeping the boss happy.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Most manufacturers don‚Äôt like taking risks at first, so back up your pitch with proof. Case studies, success stories, and pilots aren‚Äôt optional‚Äîthey‚Äôre essential\n\nNow y‚Äôall must be wondering where doescome into the picture?\n\nLet me tell you how: Our AI agents help manufacturers by taking up the more complex and time consuming task so that our clients can focus on what really matters i.e. building relationships, closing deals and driving growth.\n\nNo more getting stuck in endless approval cycles or fighting with spreadsheets. Just clear, simple data to cut through the corporate quicksand.\n\nSo, next time you‚Äôre in a meeting with 12 decision-makers and zero decisions, remember this: closing deals isn‚Äôt about luck. It‚Äôs about strategy, empathy, and the right tools to cut through the chaos. And if you‚Äôre wondering where to find those tools, let‚Äôs just say... I have an idea \n\nUntil next time, happy deal-closing, and may your pipeline be ever in your favor!",

Part of me wanted to say, ‚ÄúCan we take a breath and focus on real solutions?‚Äù But I was scared of sounding rude. Now I know a timely reset can save everyone from frustration.\n\n‚ÄúI Disagree‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Why.‚Äù\n\nI had legitimate concerns but stayed silent, fearing backlash or appearing difficult. In hindsight, disagreement (with respect) sparks better ideas. The cost of silence? Missed innovation.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Sure I Understand.‚Äù\n\nNodding along was easier than risking embarrassment. But confusion doesn‚Äôt vanish by pretending. If I had just asked for clarity, others would have breathed a sigh of relief too.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Avoiding the Real Issue.‚Äù\n\nWe tiptoed around the elephant in the room, dancing around tough questions. By avoiding hard truths, we built shallow consensus. Speaking up might have felt uncomfortable, but it would‚Äôve led to genuine progress.\n\n‚ÄúHow Do We Make This Meeting Worth Our Time?‚Äù\n\nDeep down, I wanted to ask why we were all gathered, burning precious hours. There‚Äôs power in questioning the status quo and refocusing on outcomes that truly matter.\n\n‚ÄúI Appreciate Everyone‚Äôs Input, But Let‚Äôs Get Real.‚Äù\n\nThe room was filled with safe, polite statements. Sometimes, we crave permission to be brutally honest. I wish I had given it‚Äîbecause real growth starts when masks come off.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm Afraid to Speak Up‚ÄîBut I Care Too Much Not To.‚Äù\n\nHonesty is scary. Yet silence slowly erodes our sense of purpose. When we speak from a place of genuine care, even tough feedback can strengthen a team rather than tear it apart.\n\nIt‚Äôs Time to Say What Matters\n\nMeetings shouldn‚Äôt drain our energy‚Äîthey should move us forward.
