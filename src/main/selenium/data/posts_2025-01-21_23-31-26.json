      "content": "All in \nhashtag\n#Leadership: When you’re right…& when you think you’re right\n\nImagine a\nwalks into a meeting, slams their fist on the table, & declares, “I’m right, & we’re going all in!” Everyone nods nervously because, well, they look confident. But here’s the twist—being right isn’t about looking confident or yelling louder than everyone else. It’s about knowing when your idea is rooted in solid judgment & when it’s just a bold shot in the dark.\n\nBecause let’s be real, going “all in” without being truly right isn’t leadership. It’s gambling with the company’s future.\n\nBeing right isn’t about ego; it’s about accuracy.\noften mistake their gut instincts for universal truths, but history shows us the cost of unchecked confidence. Consider Blockbuster. They were sure people would never want to stream movies. Enter Netflix. Lesson? Believing you’re right without evidence can turn your company into a case study—for the wrong reasons.\n\nResearch by Jim Collins shows that successful leaders embrace what he calls “Level 5 Leadership,” a mix of professional will & personal\n. They aren’t just right—they’re carefully right, basing decisions on data, listening to others, & questioning their own assumptions.\n\nWhen you know you’re right (& have the receipts to prove it), hesitation is fatal. A few examples:\n\n• Steve Jobs: He didn’t hesitate to go all in on the iPhone despite skeptics calling it “just another phone.”\n\n• Indra Nooyi: She doubled down on healthier product lines, betting on a future of conscious consumption.\n\n• You, the reader: Remember that time you ordered pineapple pizza even though your friends mocked you? You stood your ground—& they secretly loved it.\n\nThe takeaway? When you’ve done your homework & the data backs your gut, go all in. But—& this is a big but—don’t skip the homework.\n\nHere’s where it gets dangerous: the overconfident leader who assumes they’re right all the time. Research reveals that\nis one of the most common leadership pitfalls. It blinds leaders to alternate perspectives & makes them double down on bad decisions.\n\nHow to be carefully right:\n\n• Validate your assumptions: Before going all in, test your ideas. Pilot programs & feedback loops are your friends.\n\n• Stay open to dissent: Surround yourself with people who challenge you. The best leaders don’t want yes-people; they want truth-tellers.\n\n• Know when to back off: Being wrong isn’t failure—it’s data. Use it to pivot, not to panic.\n\nLeadership requires\n, no doubt. But courage without humility is a recipe for disaster. The difference between a reckless leader & a great one is this: the great one knows they’re right because they’ve done the work, not because they feel like it.\n\nSo, when you’re ready to go all in, remember:\nis contagious, but evidence is convincing. Be the leader who inspires both.\n\n& if you’re ever unsure, ask yourself: Is this decision based on insight, or am I just hoping pineapple pizza wins the day?",

Borders.\n\nRemember the relentless tech disruption narrative from 2010?\n\nThese companies were cautionary tales, and the question on everyone’s mind was who’s next?\n\nSurely Walmart & Target were doomed, Airbnb would crush Marriott, & Toyota would fall to Tesla, Uber, Waymo, or all three.\n\nWho needed a Gym in the age of Peloton, or Bank when we've got an neoBank.\n\nBut then… nothing much happened.\n\nFor all the talk of “Disrupt or Die,” “Digital Darwinism,” and “Creative Destruction,” reality turned out far less dramatic.\n\nYes, Toys \"R\" Us failed, but that was more about debt.\n\nSears? Almost gone, but retail bankruptcies are the same rate as they ever were.\n\nOf the Global Fortune 500, only NEW 12 companies were added in the last 25 years, while 324 new arrivals were older companies growing.\n\nDisruption didn’t sweep through industries as we imagined.\n\nInstead, the Internet redistributed distribution costs more than it rewrote the rules of business.\n\nDigital didn’t expand the addressable market as much as we thought.\n\nDigital didn’t change the fundamentals. People value convenience but also trust, reliability, and time-tested basics.\n\nThe Real Problem: Operational Apathy and Distractions.\n\nCompanies get stuck in their own processes.\n\nThey waste energy chasing distractions instead of focusing on meaningful, medium-sized changes that drive efficiency.\n\nThe best companies balance innovation with maintenance. They harness technology where it counts—calmly, strategically, and on their terms—not as a reaction to fear, but as a deliberate effort to make money and delight consumers.\n\nIt’s not always about inventing new economic rules but using great ideas to make even more sense in a digital age.\n\n-Success lies in delighting customers.\n-In maintaining the core while upgrading intelligently.\n-In reliability, continuous improvements, and the basics done brilliantly.\n\nAnd this is where—the sponsor of this post—excels.\n\nThey help businesses take control of their IT landscapes by offering third-party support for Oracle, SAP, and VMware systems.\n\nCompanies can now reduce the costs and complexity of vendor-provided maintenance, while gaining access to high-quality, personalized support from experienced engineers.\n\nBy extending the life of critical systems and addressing challenges like interoperability and vulnerability management, Spinnaker Support empowers businesses to focus on what truly matters—innovation, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.\n\nFor organizations caught in the endless cycle of costly upgrades or struggling to find the right time for transformative changes, Spinnaker provides a smarter alternative: maintaining the core systems that drive the business, while freeing up resources for strategic growth.\n\nDisruption isn’t everything. Focus, widespread improvements, and customer satisfaction? Maybe that’s the future.",
