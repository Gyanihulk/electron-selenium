Want to take this mindset and put it into action\nJoin me and the 10 other speakers at the 2025 Level Up Summit.\n\nIt's an incredible space to learn, connect, and reimagine your success on your terms.

      "content": "Promoting too soon might be a sign of a recruiting problem.\n\nHere’s something to think about: When you promote someone too quickly, is it because they earned it, or because you don’t have any other options?\n\nTo be clear, I firmly believe that companies should develop their people and promote them from within. But, building top-performing sales teams often requires a blend of internal & external hiring.\n\nThe 2023 @The Bridge Group Sales Development Report revealed some eye-opening trends:\n\n️The average tenure for SDRs fell to 1.4 years in 2022, breaking a multi-year trend.\n️Productivity = Tenure - Ramp. Once you subtract ramp time, the median SDR only spends 16 months at full productivity before moving on.\n\nHere’s why that matters:\n\nIf you’re promoting reps too soon, you may be robbing your team of critical development productivity time.\n\nAnd it’s often because you’re covering up a recruiting issue—the absence of a robust candidate funnel that can fill the open reqs needed to hit the sales plan.\n\nA premature promotion doesn’t fix the problem. It creates new ones:\n\n️Teams get burned out when they lack strong performers. Or when junior teams are pilfered for early recruits\n️You promote reps before they’re ready, but they flounder in next-level roles, ultimately putting more pressure on the system.\n️Your talent pipeline suffers because you lose productive contributors too quickly.\n\nInstead of rushing people up the ladder, ask yourself:\n\n️Is our recruiting strategy effective in bringing in a funnel of high-quality candidates?\n️Am I hiring people who can ramp up fast, deliver results, and stay long enough to truly make an impact?\n️Are the recruiting AND leadership teams doing enough joint outreach to external top performers to build a talent bench?\n️Is your company’s social brand solid enough to attract the best talent?\n\nHire the right people, set them up for success, and give them time to own their role. One-quarter of successful performance after ramp does not automatically make someone promotion-worthy.\n\nPromotions should be earned—not used to paper over gaps.\n\nBecause a rushed promotion today might mean bigger problems tomorrow.",

Foundation (1 Month, 1 hour daily)\n• Master Python syntax, control flow & functions\n• Get comfortable with data structures & OOP\n• Learn essential tools: virtual environments, pip & Git\n\n2. Intermediate Journey (2 Months, 1 Hour daily)\n• Dive into web scraping & API integration\n• Conquer databases & testing\n• Explore async programming & popular libraries\n\n3. Advanced Territory (1 Month, 2+ hours daily)\n• Build with web frameworks (Django/Flask)\n• Explore data science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)\n• Deploy to cloud & containerize applications\n• Master CI/CD & optimization\n\nTips for Success:\n• Build 2-3 real projects in each phase\n• Join the open-source community\n• Connect with Python enthusiasts on Discord/Reddit\n• Study popular codebases\n• Document your journey\n• Remember to take breaks!\n\nConsistency trumps intensity. 10 focused hours/week will take you further than cramming 10 hours in two days!\n\nWhat's your take on this roadmap?",

Fitting in can feel like wearing a mask – it works on the surface, but deep down, it drains you. Belonging, on the other hand, is when you feel truly seen and aligned with the environment around you.\nYour point about belonging being energizing is spot on. It’s not just about being in the right place but being in a space where your values, purpose, and work truly connect. When that happens, you’re not just surviving—you’re thriving.\nThis post is such a powerful reminder to reflect: Am I adapting to fit in, or am I embracing my authenticity to belong?
