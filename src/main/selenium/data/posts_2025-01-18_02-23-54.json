      "content": "Hispanic SDR placed on PIP and terminated with no severance weeks after filing for paternity leave with the company and with the state he lives in. \n\nI worked with a young SDR named Miguel, who is the sole provider for his family of four, including two children under the age of three.\n\nUp until he requested leave, there were no complaints or concerns about performance.  Despite tracking to 70% of his goal, while several of his white colleagues were at just 20% and were not on a PIP or terminated, Miguel was terminated just 6 days prior to his scheduled paternity leave.\n\nMiguel experienced differing treatment throughout his tenure, feeling it was driven by discriminatory factors and blatant favoritism.\n\nMiguel lives in one of the 12 states in the U.S. that have state-based paid FMLA leave. His leave was approved by the state and sent to his employer who denied ever receiving it as a defense for Miguelâ€™s wrongful termination.\n\nDespite Miguelâ€™s low salary and unlikeness of a lucrative outcome, I was happy to help him. It angers me to hear when people are taken advantage of and mistreated like this.\n\nMiguel did an incredible job with our assistance putting together a reputationally damaging and shameful document and forwarded it on to the HR person who terminated him.\n\nThe response back was a big beat it and not a very respectful way. We escalated to the head of HR and were ignored. Next, we escalated to the CEO who requested a call with Miguel.\n\nWe prepared Miguel for the call, and he did a great job. The CEO expressed his empathy for Miguelâ€™s situation and agreed to offer one monthâ€™s severance and healthcare.\n\nWhile the gesture was appreciated, it was most definitely not enough. If Miguel had not been wrongly terminated, he would have been eligible for 12 weeksâ€™ paid leave.\n\nWe went back two more times to the CEO, who eventually agreed to 3 monthsâ€™ severance and healthcare after being terminated with no severance.\n\nThe outcome to me was worth far more than any fee we received for our work. Knowing the impact that our work has in peopleâ€™s lives is the most rewarding work of my lifetime.",
