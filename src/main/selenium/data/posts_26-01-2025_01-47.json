      "content": "Back in Vegas, Back on Stage.\n\nFirst time here since February of 2022. And like the last time, I‚Äôm in front of nearly 400 sales professionals.\n\nWhile not my usual meeting rhetoric, facilitating is facilitating. Whether it‚Äôs a sales kickoff or a cross-functional strategic meeting, the principles don‚Äôt change.\n\nThe stakes are high, the audience expects connection, relevance, and value on stage or off.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned about delivering impact, no matter the size of the room:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Perfection is a myth ‚Äì Stop chasing it. This doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt prepare‚Äîpreparation is critical. But the goal isn‚Äôt to feel rehearsed; they want you to be authentic. Bring in things happening in the room, adapt as needed, and make it feel alive‚Äînot like you‚Äôre reading from a script.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Humor wins ‚Äì A few well-timed self-deprecating jokes can humanize you, break the tension, and make 400 people feel like a connected group. But this isn‚Äôt the time to be a stand-up comic. Humor should be natural, relatable, and enhance your message‚Äînot distract from it.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Real work beats simulations ‚Äì Role-plays and simulations have their place, especially for shifting mindsets or building habits. But when it comes to sales audiences, nothing beats solving real challenges. It‚Äôs tougher to coordinate, but it‚Äôs what leaders and reps truly want-->tangible, actionable outcomes that they can use immediately.\n\nWhether it‚Äôs a meeting or a mainstage, the goal‚Äôs the same: create moments that matter.\n\nBeing back on stage is exhilarating...and yeah, the laughs help too.\n\nWhat‚Äôs your secret for engaging a big audience?",
