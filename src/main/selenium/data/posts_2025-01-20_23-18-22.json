      "content": "The Power of Genuine Connection\n\nYesterday, I found myself reflecting on a long-time client who had faced a particularly challenging year. At 71, he continues to inspire me with his resilience.\n\nDespite a year filled with medical scares and adversity, he stays committed to living an active, purposeful life. He weight trains, swims, and boxes regularly, all while maintaining his career as a practicing psychiatrist.\n\nHe reminds me that adversity comes to us all‚Äîit‚Äôs how we respond that defines us. He‚Äôs living proof that life doesn‚Äôt stop at 65. Purpose and mindset keep him young and vibrant, showing us that staying engaged with life is far better than settling into a passive routine.\n\nRewind to Christmas Day, and I had the privilege of connecting with two older relatives of a friend, aged 90 and 88. They were so sharp, engaged, and full of life, you could have mistaken them for being decades younger.\n\nThe 90-year-old still drives and worked until 80, while his partner shared vivid childhood stories and life lessons with me. I was struck by their wisdom, their energy, and their zest for life.\n\nWhen I asked them what had kept them so young, their habits and choices were telling: minimal alcohol use, purposeful living, and staying mentally sharp through meaningful engagement.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm not here to tell you to quit drinking or work past retirement age, but there‚Äôs something to be said for paying attention to those ahead of us in life.\n\nWhat habits have defined them? What choices have shaped their lives? How can we learn from their stories and their wisdom?\n\nIn a world so obsessed with likes, posts, and fleeting digital interactions, it‚Äôs easy to overlook the power of true human connection. But it‚Äôs through real conversations‚Äîlistening, sharing, learning‚Äîthat we grow as individuals and as a society.\n\nConnection is what built this incredible world we live in today. Not reels, not emails, not content. It‚Äôs the stories, lessons, and humanity we share with each other.\n\nSo, I encourage you: Go out and connect today. Talk to someone with a different story or perspective. Learn from their walk in life. You might discover a habit to emulate, a mindset to adopt, or even something you want to stop doing.\n\nConnection has the power to make us all better humans. Let‚Äôs not forget that.",

It‚Äôs hard not to compare yourself to the veterans who have been doing this for years. But that‚Äôs also what made it so inspiring. It was a reminder that growth doesn‚Äôt come from staying comfortable‚Äîit comes from surrounding yourself with people who challenge and push you to be better.\n\nThroughout the year, I‚Äôve been bouncing around the leaderboard, grabbing a few top-three spots but never quite landing in the number one position. It felt like the universe decided to align everything just when I needed it most‚ÄîSaturday was my moment! Kicking off the Annual Meeting as the top rookie for the month was incredibly validating and the perfect way to start the weekend on a high note.\n\nI walked away from this weekend with so much knowledge and inspiration, and I can‚Äôt wait to bring that back to the clients and teams I work with.

      "content": "Steal this hack to improve your EQ in 2025.\n\nEQ is a crucial element of professional success. \n\nWe talk a lot about the importance of curiosity, empathy, active listening, etc but VERY few folks engage in work to build those skills. As a result, their EQ suffers.\n\nWant a way to flex your EQ muscles? Read fiction.\n\nIn 2024, I read 60 books.\n19 non-fiction\n41 fiction, including some fantasy SAGAS (hello Wind & Truth)\n\nReading books like Mexican Gothic, Afong Moy, and Shadow of the Wind I got to peer into different cultures.\n\nThrough books like Parable of the Talents & The Women, I got an idea of the deep emotional and psychological landscapes that drive people‚Äôs actions.\n\nBy getting a view into the lived experience - the inner struggles, motivations, and decisions - of characters who are so different from me, I grow.\n\n\nÔ∏è Research consistently shows that reading fiction offers several unique benefits that improve our social cognition and emotional intelligence:\n\n- Fiction reading leads to a s statistically significant improvement in social-cognitive performance.\n\n- Fiction helps readers better understand others' perspectives and emotions, leading to more compassionate and informed actions.\n\n- Fiction reading boosts neural connectivity in the brain‚Äôs somatosensory cortex, meaning we not only understand emotions intellectually, but we also \"embody\" them.\n\n- By reducing the need for cognitive closure, fiction readers learn to consider multiple perspectives before making decisions, an essential skill in leadership and collaboration.\n\n- Fiction also offers psychological and social benefits, like improved problem-solving skills and reduced prejudice, by encouraging us to recognize the shared humanity in others, even those vastly different from us.\n\n- Fiction reading activates brain regions associated with real-world social cognition, more so than non-fiction or no reading at all.\n\n\nWhile non-fiction is invaluable for factual knowledge (I literally host a monthly non-fiction), fiction excels at developing emotional intelligence and social acuity.\n\nFor me, reading fiction has been more than an escape. It has been a way to enhance my ability to connect with others, understand their perspectives, and lead with empathy.\n\n\n In a world that is more divided and decisive than any, I believe reading more fiction from authors who don't look like you is part of the answer.\n\nCan that be part of your answer in 2025?\n\n\nP.S.
