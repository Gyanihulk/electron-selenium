Why would I be the lucky one?\n\nThey're better so it makes sense they'll be the winners...\n\nEssentially, I thought that there's some sort of ranking, and because I'm not the absolute best at everything in life, I don't deserve or I'm not worthy enough to get what I want...\n\nThe \"aim low because that's what you deserve\" mentality....\n\nBut no surprise here, I was wrong...Very wrong...\n\nAnd the thing that made me most wrong is my definition of confidence...\n\nI thought...That confidence means you're better than the rest...\n\nThat a confident person is the person who believes they're god's gift to earth and they're the ultimate answer to every problem...\n\nSo...Whenever I realized that I'm not the best at something, I immediately shrank and I felt it in my core...I'm not the best...I should hide...Run away...Burry myself...Never try...I don't deserve to...\n\nBut confidence is not thinking you're the absolute best at everything...It's not thinking that you're better than others...It's believing that you can figure it out...You can handle whatever life throws at you...Being confident is going for what you want (despite not being the best at the moment) and believing that you can get it...You will get it...You'll figure out a way...You are the master of your own destiny.\n\nHow about you? What's your definition of confidence?\n\nP.S. This is the first part (yes, It was a very long post). Stay tuned for the sequel. ",

And suddenly, ‚Äúsoon‚Äù turned into weeks.\n\nI never forgot that promise and now, I‚Äôm finally back, ready to pick up where I left off everything.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I‚Äôll be sharing my entrepreneurial journey so far, the powerful lessons I‚Äôve learned, and the inspiring people I‚Äôve met along the way. This experience has already challenged me, shaped me, and reminded me why I started in the first place.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever hit pause on something important, you‚Äôll know how hard it can be to start again.\nBut here I am, showing up because it‚Äôs never too late to continue what truly matters.\n\nSo tell me,what have you been working on?

This isn‚Äôt just Coinbase. This week, hackers tore through DeFi protocols, centralized exchanges, and individual wallets, stealing millions through every possible attack vector. No one is safe.\n Ionic Money? Exploited for $7M.\n Xeggex Exchange? Multi-million dollar hot wallet drain.\n Telegram support scams? Exploding, with users handing over their private keys without hesitation.\n DeFi rug pulls? Still happening, still draining portfolios overnight.\n\nThe Worst Part? It‚Äôs not one type of attack‚Äîit‚Äôs everything, everywhere, all at once.\n\nThe Game Has Changed\nScammers aren‚Äôt just running Discord bots and Telegram phishing campaigns anymore. They‚Äôre using AI, deepfake voices, and real-time social engineering to break into accounts and wallets.\n\nSome ‚Äúinsider‚Äù leaks point to centralized exchange API keys being compromised, leading to sudden balance wipes. Elsewhere, DeFi devs are inserting hidden backdoors into smart contracts‚Äîeven after audits.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the kicker: the biggest hacks haven‚Äôt even been discovered yet.\nSurvival Requires a Mindset Shift\n\nMost people in Web3 think a good wallet and 2FA will keep them safe. That‚Äôs outdated thinking. The real threats today are:\n AI-powered phishing campaigns that mimic real support teams.\n Compromised developer accounts pushing poisoned code.\n Backdoored smart contracts designed to fail months after launch.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in crypto, you‚Äôre in a war zone. Your money is constantly under attack.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\nExchanges will fall. Hackers are already inside some of them.\nRug pulls will evolve. New projects will launch with pre-planned exploits.\nSecurity tools will fail. Because no one‚Äôs thinking far enough ahead.\nThe reality? Web3 isn‚Äôt ready for what‚Äôs coming next. But the ones who adapt‚Äîwho stay ahead of the threats‚Äîwill be the ones who survive.\n\nAre you ready? \n What‚Äôs the biggest risk you‚Äôre seeing in the wild?

Plan shattered. Future unknown.\n\nMost people would‚Äôve crumbled. He didn‚Äôt.\n\nInstead, he did what every great leader does: he pivoted, adapted, and built something even bigger.\n\nFor nearly three decades,has led Learnit, a global training company that has helped 1.8 million professionals upskill and stay ahead in their careers.\n\nBest-selling author, CEO, podcast host - Damon spent decades proving one thing - the ability to learn, grow, and reinvent yourself is the ultimate competitive advantage.\n\nThinking of leaving your corporate job to start your own thing?\nHere is Damon's advice:\n\n Own it.

Someone Owns Data Quality\n\n- Data isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúavailable‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs trusted\n- There‚Äôs a clear owner ensuring clean, accurate data\n\nPro-Tip: Assign a dedicated leader to data governance. If no one is responsible, everyone is guessing.\n\n2. New Projects Start With a Data Plan\n\n- Data collection is considered before the first line of code\n- Performance tracking is built into launches from day one\n\nPro-Tip: Make data planning mandatory in project kickoffs. If it‚Äôs an afterthought, you‚Äôll always be playing catch-up.\n\n3. Opinions Come With Numbers\n\n- People naturally back up their ideas with data\n- The phrase ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the data?‚Äù is part of daily discussions\n\nPro-Tip: Normalize data-backed decision-making. If gut feelings drive key choices, you‚Äôre not data-driven.\n\n4. Bad Numbers Aren‚Äôt Hidden\n\n- Underperformance isn‚Äôt ignored‚Äîit‚Äôs analyzed\n- Data is used to improve, not to blame\n\nPro-Tip: Encourage transparency. If teams fear sharing bad results, they‚Äôll manipulate data instead of fixing problems.\n\n5. Everyone Can Access Relevant Data\n\n- Teams don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúask IT‚Äù for key reports\n- Employees can quickly pull insights related to their work\n\nPro-Tip: Invest in self-service analytics. If data is locked away, it‚Äôs useless.\n\n6. Every Goal Has a Measurable Target\n\n- Objectives come with clear KPIs, not vague aspirations\n- Success is measured, not assumed\n\nPro-Tip: Tie every strategic goal to a specific metric. If you can‚Äôt measure it, you won‚Äôt improve it.\n\n7. Data Training Is a Priority\n\n- Employees know how to interpret and use data\n- Data literacy is seen as a core skill, not an ‚Äúextra‚Äù\n\nPro-Tip: Provide ongoing data education. If only the analysts understand data, your company isn‚Äôt truly data-driven.\n\nData-driven isn‚Äôt a claim. It‚Äôs a culture.\n\nAnd if your company isn‚Äôt there yet‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time to make a change.\n\n\nEnjoy this?\n\nFollowfor tips on GenAI adoption, data engineering, and leadership.",

So I asked myself:\n\n If I could only get one thing done today, what would it be?\n\nThat simple question changed everything.\n\n It forced me to focus.\n It cut out distractions.\n It made my actions matter.\n\nAnd guess what? The more I prioritized the right things, the more impact I had.\n\nLook, we‚Äôre all human. We forget things. We have days where we stare at our to-do list and think, \"Nope. Not today.\" But when we have structure‚Äîjust enough to keep us moving but not enough to make us feel trapped‚Äîit creates freedom.\n\n Freedom to serve more people.\n Freedom to scale our business.\n Freedom to actually enjoy the process.\n\nSo today, instead of trying to do everything, ask yourself:\n\n What‚Äôs the one thing that absolutely has to get done?\n\nThen go do it.\n\nWhat‚Äôs your One Thing today?\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear it!",

During university, I had a few jobs as a programmer or system administrator, but after university, I wanted to work only in IT security (cyber security was not a common term at that time), so all\nthe full-time jobs on my CV relate to that field.\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è What is the most appealing thing to you about working in cyber security?\n\nI love the intellectual challenge and the constant change. I like to solve problems, analyze complex systems and scenarios and learn new things all the time. Some people get their adrenaline boost from physical activities and I get mine from mental exercise.\n\n Name a book/movie that has inspired you. Anything specific to cyber security that you would recommend?\n\n‚ÄúAda, the Enchantress of Numbers: Prophet of the Computer Age‚Äù by Betty Alexandra Toole\n\n I recommend you to follow her , like and comment on this post to share her example, and perhaps suggest others to showcase !\n\n>>> This profile is part of a series I‚Äôm publishing every other day in collaboration with @Women4Cyber Foundation, follow me to receive the next updates.",

Disengaged, cautious, and resistant to change.\n\nSo, what makes the difference?\n\nI can tell‚Äîalmost immediately‚Äîwhen a practice has a high-performing team:\n\n Staff show up energised and full of ideas\n There‚Äôs a genuine sense of teamwork and shared purpose\n Conversations focus on better patient outcomes\n Leaders ask questions, listen, and encourage\n\nAnd then, there are the teams where something feels‚Ä¶ off.\n\n Staff seem on edge or unusually quiet\n Leaders do most of the talking (or worse‚Äîdirecting)\n There‚Äôs a lack of collaboration or ownership\n High staff turnover is common\n\nSo, what‚Äôs the real secret to transforming these struggling teams?\n\nGreat Leaders Aren‚Äôt Born‚ÄîThey‚Äôre Developed\nMany managers step into leadership without structured training. I was one of them.\n\nEarly in my career, I was promoted into management with little guidance. I struggled. It wasn‚Äôt until I asked for help, enroled in coaching, and committed to learning leadership skills that everything changed.\n\nWithin 12 months, I went from failing manager to leading an award-winning, high-performing team.\n\n Every leader has blind spots (it‚Äôs part of being human)\n Self-awareness is the key to unlocking leadership potential\n With the right training, culture and performance transform\n\nThe Secret? Psychological Safety \n\nIf there‚Äôs one defining characteristic of high-performing teams, it‚Äôs this:\n\n Team members feel comfortable (safe) sharing their ideas and asking questions. They also take calculated risks‚Äîwithout fear of embarrassment or punishment.\n\nThis is psychological safety, and it‚Äôs the foundation of collaboration, innovation, and strong leadership.\n\nWhen leaders create a safe, open environment, teams become:\nÔ∏è More engaged\nÔ∏è More Innovative\nÔ∏è More committed to a shared purpose\n\nBut when people fear speaking up, performance plummets, stress rises, and turnover skyrockets.\n\nHow to Build Psychological Safety\n Start with Clarity ‚Äì Define your team‚Äôs purpose and values.\n\n Listen More, Talk Less ‚Äì Great leaders ask more questions than they answer.\n Encourage Ideas ‚Äì Every voice matters. Create space for innovation.\n Build Trust ‚Äì Be transparent, show empathy, and recognize contributions.\n\nIf your culture isn‚Äôt producing the results you need‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs talk.\n\nEveryone has untapped potential.\n\nIf you feel your team could benefit from a more collaborative, empowered, and engaged culture, let‚Äôs connect.\n\n Drop me a message or comment below‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!",

Most big tech companies never made similar commitments.

See a quick summary below, or find the full preprint here:.\n\nIn my work and in the Neural Interfacing Lab at,, we are interested in decoding behavior from brain-wide recordings, particularly movement in my case. We work together with participants implanted with sEEG electrodes allowing us to record neural activity throughout the brain.\n\nIn previous work, we described how movement can be decoded from brain-wide neural activity, across tasks and across participants. However, this was only decoding between move and rest, so naturally we wanted to know more about the neural content of these brain-wide dynamics.\n\nTo investigate, we recorded 3D hand movement trajectory while our participants played a custom made game where the goal was to move a pufferfish to a bubble to pop it. From the trajectories, we retrieved position, velocity, speed and acceleration. At the same time, we recorded neural activity from cortical and sub-cortical brain areas.\n\nWe extracted low frequency activity (< 5 HZ), mid frequency power (8 - 30 Hz) and high-frequency power (55 - 200 Hz), windowed the data (300ms length, 50ms shift), and used preferential subspace identification (PSID) to decode 12 kinematics.\n\nWe found that non-directional hand movement speed can be decoded using low, mid and high frequency information. Particularly, the low frequency activity reached substantial decoding performance (up to 0.76 + 0.03). Decoding directional components was a much bigger challenge for the decoder.\n\nIf we look at the electrode contact locations that were significantly correlated with hand movement speed, we observe that these contacts are located throughout the brain, including cortical and subcortical structures.\n\nAbout the decoding of the directional kinematics. It turns out that if we change the reference frame from the sensor to the goal, that the decoder becomes able to decode position w.r.t. the target above chance! It suggests that the brain represents goal-directed movement in relationship to that goal.\n\nOverall, the decoder reached the highest performance using low frequency activity. The phase information is important, as the performance was substantially lower when we used the power. This neural signal shares similarities with the local motor potential described in the motor cortex.\n\nOur results provide a comprehensive overview of the decodable movement-related information in brain-wide neural activity, and strengthen our previous results that the whole brain may be involved in generating movement.\n\nWe are excited about this work and hope you enjoy reading it. As we always do in our lab, we share code and data publicly. Please find the code here:.",

A never-before-seen concept.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nI wasted time trying to be original when I should‚Äôve been studying what was already working.\n\nTrying to reinvent the wheel slowed me down, and nearly made me quit.\n\nOnce I shifted my mindset, everything changed. Success is not about being first. It‚Äôs about being better.\n\nApple didn‚Äôt invent smartphones.\nThey just made them better.\n\nFacebook wasn‚Äôt the first social network.\nThey just built a better experience.\n\nGoogle wasn‚Äôt the first search engine.\nThey just did it best.\n\nSo when my clients ask how to grow on YouTube, I tell them this:\n\n Pick a niche that already has winners. If others are making money in it, that‚Äôs proof it works.\n\n Study their strategies. Look at their top-performing content, their thumbnails, their titles - reverse-engineer their success.\n\n Refine and execute. Take what works, add your unique edge, improve the quality, and go all in.\n\nThis is how you win. Not by wasting time trying to be different, but by being better.\nThat‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the game.\n\nIf you're trying to grow on YouTube (or any business), don‚Äôt waste time trying to be completely unique.\n\nModel success, refine it with your own edge, and execute relentlessly.\n\nInnovation is great.\nBut execution is what wins.\nEvery. Single. Time.\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel.\nJust make it better.\n\nAre you making the same mistake I did? Or are you ready to dominate? Let‚Äôs talk.\n\nP.S.

        "content": "Micromanagement doesn‚Äôt improve performance.\n\nIt drives your best people away.\n\nIt's not just shouting or threats - it's often subtle, unintentional behaviours that create uncertainty, anxiety, and disengagement.\n\nHere are 8 common fear-based behaviours leaders might display - and how to fix them:\n\n 1. Unclear expectations.\nYour team feels like they‚Äôre guessing what success looks like, leaving them unsure and anxious.\n\n Set clear, measurable goals.\nDefine what success looks like for every project. Use regular check-ins to ensure alignment and clarity.\n\n 2. Imposing unnecessary urgency.\nFake deadlines or piling on ‚Äúemergency‚Äù tasks might seem like driving results, but it breeds stress and burnout.\n\n Align urgency with priorities.\nExplain why deadlines matter and connect them to business goals. Ensure the workload is realistic.\n\n 3. Using vague or critical feedback.\nStatements like ‚ÄúWe need to talk about your performance‚Äù without explanation leave employees fearful and defensive.\n\n Offer actionable feedback.\nUse a constructive approach: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs working, here‚Äôs where improvement is needed, and here‚Äôs how I‚Äôll support you.‚Äù\n\n 4. Micromanaging tasks.\nStepping in to ‚Äúfix‚Äù things or taking over sends the message that you don‚Äôt trust your team.\n\n Delegate and empower.\nGive your team ownership of tasks and let them find solutions, even if it means learning through mistakes.\n\n 5. Ignoring achievements.\nFocusing only on mistakes and what‚Äôs not working demotivates your team over time.\n\n Celebrate wins regularly.\nRecognise successes - big or small. Regular appreciation builds confidence and encourages better performance.\n\n 6. Keeping your team in the dark.\nWhen employees don‚Äôt have visibility into decisions or changes, it creates uncertainty and mistrust.\n\n Be transparent.\nCommunicate openly about decisions, changes, and challenges. Transparency builds trust and loyalty.\n\n 7. Creating fear around job security.\nSaying things like, ‚ÄúMany people would love to have your role,‚Äù fosters a toxic, competitive environment.\n\n Provide reassurance and growth paths.\nFocus on development: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how we can work together to build your skills and grow your career.‚Äù\n\n 8. Treating performance reviews as threats.\nUsing appraisals as punishment creates fear instead of driving improvement.\n\n Turn reviews into coaching opportunities.\nUse performance reviews to discuss growth, strengths, and opportunities for the future‚Äînot as a disciplinary tool.\n\nFear doesn‚Äôt lead to excellence - trust does.\n\nThe best leaders create environments where their teams feel supported, safe, and empowered to innovate and grow.\n\nWhat‚Äôs one leadership habit you‚Äôre improving right now?\n Repost to inspire more empowered workplaces.\n Follow me, Jen Blandos, for daily insights on leadership, business, and workplace wellbeing.",

But did you know that banks also use Musharakah to fund businesses while staying Shari‚Äôah-compliant?\n\nLet‚Äôs explore the two key types of Musharakah‚ÄîShirkat-ul-Milk and Shirkat-ul-Aqd‚Äîand see how they shape financial partnerships.\n\n1. Shirkat-ul-Milk: Ownership-Based Partnership\nThis type of Musharakah happens when two or more people jointly own an asset, either by choice or by circumstance.\n\n Example: Ayesha and Zaid inherit a commercial property. Instead of selling it, they rent it out and share the rental income. This is Shirkat-ul-Milk in action!\nBut Musharakah isn‚Äôt just about co-owning properties‚Äîit plays a vital role in banking too!\n\n2. Shirkat-ul-Aqd: Business-Based Partnership\nThis is the true essence of Musharakah in Islamic banking, where partners pool capital, expertise, or resources for a business venture.\n\n Example: A startup needs funding, and an Islamic bank steps in, forming a Musharakah agreement. The bank provides capital, while the entrepreneurs contribute their skills. Profits are shared based on a pre-agreed ratio, and any loss is borne according to capital contribution.\n\nHow Banks Apply Musharakah\n\n Musharakah Financing: Instead of interest-based loans, banks invest in businesses, sharing profits and risks.\n\n Home Financing: The bank and the customer jointly purchase a house, with the customer gradually buying the bank‚Äôs share.\n\n Agricultural & SME Growth: Farmers and small businesses get direct investment rather than debt, fostering sustainable expansion.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\n Risk-sharing builds trust and fairness.\n Entrepreneurs get real support, not just loans.\n Banking becomes a tool for growth, not just profit.\n\nWhat‚Äôs Next?\n\nIn our next post, we‚Äôll dive into Mudarabah, another fascinating Islamic finance model that fuels businesses while keeping risk and reward balanced. Stay tuned!\n\n Have you seen Musharakah in action? Would you prefer a profit-sharing model over traditional loans? Let‚Äôs discuss in the comments!",

Own your routine\n- Without a plan, you‚Äôll follow someone else‚Äôs.\n- Design a structure that aligns with your goals.\n- Build habits that move you forward, not hold you back.\n\n2. Break the comfort cycle\n- The easy path leads nowhere.\n- Growth requires discomfort.\n- Choose challenge over convenience.\n\n3. Train your mind like a muscle\n- Strength isn‚Äôt just physical, it‚Äôs mental.\n- Master the art of focus and discipline.\n- Your future depends on what you do daily.\n\n4. Cut the noise\n- Not everything deserves your attention.\n- Filter out distractions that don‚Äôt serve you.\n- Energy wasted on the wrong things is energy lost forever.\n\n5. Build momentum through action\n- Small wins create big shifts.\n- Progress compounds over time.\n- Start today, no matter how small the step.\n\n6. Adapt and evolve\n- Stagnation is the real failure.\n- The best routines adjust as you grow.\n- Stay flexible, but stay committed.\n\n7. Define success on your terms\n- Stop living by someone else‚Äôs script.\n- Own your choices, your habits, your results.\n- The life you want is built by the actions you take.\n\nMost people drift.\nThey wake up and follow the same patterns.\nPatterns they are given by others.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt take charge of your habits..\nSomeone else will.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt create your own routine..\nYou‚Äôll live by one designed for you.\n\nOwn them.

And hundreds of coaching sessions later, it's clear that it's a development area for most managers and leaders.\n\n'Feedback' is so dreaded in some cases that it becomes:\n A once-a-year performance review\n A reaction to something going wrong\n A quick ‚Äúgood job‚Äù in passing\n\nIt's such a shame! There are so many great opportunities missed when managers treat feedback in this way.\n\nJust look at what could be covered in a feedback conversation:\n Appreciation\n Strengths\n Constructive Criticism\n Career Potential\n Professional Development\n Goal Alignment\n Teamwork\n The Voice of the Customer\n\nAnd of course, feedback should be a two-way street. As well as giving their feedback, managers benefit from asking for feedback on their own behaviours!!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\nWhy are we so reluctant to give and receive feedback...and work on it?\n\nHow do we develop this competency in ouselves and in our people?",

Often, the answer is no.\n\nAnchor Yourself in the Present\nLook around. What‚Äôs happening? Notice the sounds, the light, or the people. Observing your surroundings can be surprisingly grounding.\n\nRedirect Your Energy\nUse those moments to reflect or just be. Maybe you think about something you‚Äôre grateful for. Or simply let your mind wander, it‚Äôs amazing what clarity comes when you give your thoughts space.\n\nAs a rule - not looking mindlessly at the phone during a conversation and if I absolutely must, asking the other person‚Äôs permission to attend to something because it‚Äôs urgent.\n\nBreaking the habit of mindless scrolling doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, but it starts with small, intentional choices.\n\nImagine reclaiming those moments, not as gaps to fill, but as opportunities to reconnect with yourself, people and the world around you.\n\nBecause some gaps are meant to be enjoyed.",

It‚Äôs about building relationships, fostering trust, and forming mutually beneficial partnerships that drive long-term success.\n\nRobert Cialdini, in his book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, explores the science behind persuasion and the subtle yet powerful ways in which people are influenced. He identifies six key principles that shape human behavior:\n Social Proof ‚Äì People follow the actions of others, assuming that widespread behavior is the correct one.\n Authority ‚Äì Individuals are more likely to trust and obey those in positions of perceived expertise.\n Liking ‚Äì We are more easily persuaded by people we like and relate to.\n Scarcity ‚Äì The less available something seems, the more desirable it becomes.\n Reciprocation ‚Äì A favor given often compels a favor in return, creating a cycle of mutual exchange.\n Commitment & Consistency ‚Äì Once a person commits to something, they strive to act in ways that align with that commitment.\n\n(good book/read btw - my recommendation)\n\nThese principles don‚Äôt just apply to sales, they define how we influence, lead, and collaborate. Whether you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, a leader, or a professional in any field, the key to long-term influence isn‚Äôt about convincing people to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù into your ideas. It‚Äôs about creating shared value, aligning goals, and fostering relationships that make persuasion feel natural rather than forced. Influence is not about manipulation, it‚Äôs about meaningful connection.\n\n\n\n\nHow do you use these principles in your work? Let‚Äôs discuss.",

This project highlights how machine learning can optimize inventory management, pricing, and marketing strategies.\n\nThe dataset contained multiple product and store-related features, including Item Weight, Item MRP, Outlet Size, Location Type, and Store Type. The challenge was to handle missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection for accurate sales prediction.\n\nÔ∏è Key Steps in the Project:\n Data Preprocessing: Filled missing values, standardized categories, and applied label encoding.\n Feature Engineering: Selected relevant features affecting sales.\n Model Implementation: Trained an XGBoost Regressor to predict sales.\n Evaluation: Achieved 87.59% R¬≤ on training data and 50.60% R¬≤ on test data.\n\n Results & Takeaways:\nÔ∏è The model performed well on training data but showed signs of overfitting on test data.\nÔ∏è Feature importance analysis can help optimize sales strategies.\nÔ∏è Future improvements: Hyperparameter tuning, feature scaling, and testing other models like Random Forest and Linear Regression.\n\nRetailers can leverage machine learning to optimize stock, adjust pricing, and improve customer satisfaction.
