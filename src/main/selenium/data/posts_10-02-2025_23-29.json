Why would I be the lucky one?\n\nThey're better so it makes sense they'll be the winners...\n\nEssentially, I thought that there's some sort of ranking, and because I'm not the absolute best at everything in life, I don't deserve or I'm not worthy enough to get what I want...\n\nThe \"aim low because that's what you deserve\" mentality....\n\nBut no surprise here, I was wrong...Very wrong...\n\nAnd the thing that made me most wrong is my definition of confidence...\n\nI thought...That confidence means you're better than the rest...\n\nThat a confident person is the person who believes they're god's gift to earth and they're the ultimate answer to every problem...\n\nSo...Whenever I realized that I'm not the best at something, I immediately shrank and I felt it in my core...I'm not the best...I should hide...Run away...Burry myself...Never try...I don't deserve to...\n\nBut confidence is not thinking you're the absolute best at everything...It's not thinking that you're better than others...It's believing that you can figure it out...You can handle whatever life throws at you...Being confident is going for what you want (despite not being the best at the moment) and believing that you can get it...You will get it...You'll figure out a way...You are the master of your own destiny.\n\nHow about you? What's your definition of confidence?\n\nP.S. This is the first part (yes, It was a very long post). Stay tuned for the sequel. ",

Don't say: \"That's not my job\"\n Why: Shows inflexibility. Labels you as unhelpful.\n Say: \"I can help you find the right person for this\"\n\n2.  Don't say: \"I don't get paid enough for this\"\n Why: Unprofessional. Makes you look entitled.\n Say: \"Can we discuss my role scope?\"\n\n3.  Don't say: \"Who messed this up?\"\n Why: Creates blame culture. Breeds toxicity.\n Say: \"How can we prevent this going forward?\"\n\n4.  Don't say: \"I can't work with them\"\n Why: Shows poor adaptability. Makes you look difficult.\n Say: \"How can we collaborate better?\"\n\n5.  Don't say: \"Not my problem\"\n Why: Shows poor ownership. Labels you as difficult.\n Say: \"How can I support the solution?\"\n\n6.  Don't say: \"It's not fair\"\n Why: Sounds immature. Shows poor understanding.\n Say: \"Help me understand the reasoning\"\n\n7.  Don't say: \"That's above my pay grade\"\n Why: Shows lack of initiative. Seems dismissive.\n Say: \"Let me check with the appropriate team\"\n\n8.  Don't say: \"That's impossible\"\n Why: Shows defeat. Lacks a problem-solving mindset.\n Say: \"Let's identify the main challenges\"\n\n9.  Don't say: \"I thought someone else would do it\"\n Why: Shows poor accountability. Shifts blame.\n Say: \"I should have confirmed the ownership\"\n\n10.  Don't say: \"That's how we've always done it\"\n Why: Shows resistance to change. Blocks innovation.\n Say: \"Let's evaluate if this still works best\"\n\nRemember:\nIt's not just what you say, but how you say it.\n\nEvery word shapes your reputation.\nEvery response defines your future.\n\nP.S.

Pain, in all its forms, is part of the human experience - a fleeting visitor that prompts growth, empathy, and, often, transformation.\n\nAs we navigate through the discomforts that life sometimes presents, it's worth remembering that pain is not an endless night but a passing storm, and with time, it gives way to clearer skies.\n\nHave you ever pushed through a difficult period only to emerge stronger?

This isn’t just Coinbase. This week, hackers tore through DeFi protocols, centralized exchanges, and individual wallets, stealing millions through every possible attack vector. No one is safe.\n Ionic Money? Exploited for $7M.\n Xeggex Exchange? Multi-million dollar hot wallet drain.\n Telegram support scams? Exploding, with users handing over their private keys without hesitation.\n DeFi rug pulls? Still happening, still draining portfolios overnight.\n\nThe Worst Part? It’s not one type of attack—it’s everything, everywhere, all at once.\n\nThe Game Has Changed\nScammers aren’t just running Discord bots and Telegram phishing campaigns anymore. They’re using AI, deepfake voices, and real-time social engineering to break into accounts and wallets.\n\nSome “insider” leaks point to centralized exchange API keys being compromised, leading to sudden balance wipes. Elsewhere, DeFi devs are inserting hidden backdoors into smart contracts—even after audits.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: the biggest hacks haven’t even been discovered yet.\nSurvival Requires a Mindset Shift\n\nMost people in Web3 think a good wallet and 2FA will keep them safe. That’s outdated thinking. The real threats today are:\n AI-powered phishing campaigns that mimic real support teams.\n Compromised developer accounts pushing poisoned code.\n Backdoored smart contracts designed to fail months after launch.\n\nIf you’re in crypto, you’re in a war zone. Your money is constantly under attack.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\nExchanges will fall. Hackers are already inside some of them.\nRug pulls will evolve. New projects will launch with pre-planned exploits.\nSecurity tools will fail. Because no one’s thinking far enough ahead.\nThe reality? Web3 isn’t ready for what’s coming next. But the ones who adapt—who stay ahead of the threats—will be the ones who survive.\n\nAre you ready? \n What’s the biggest risk you’re seeing in the wild? Drop a comment.\n Repost to warn others.",

        "content": "Everyone says they’re “data-driven.”\n\nBut most companies aren’t.\n\nHere’s 7 signs your company is *actually* data-driven:\n\nBeing data-driven isn’t about collecting reports.\n\nIt’s about how your company thinks, decides, and operates.\n\nIf data isn’t influencing real behavior, it’s just a buzzword.\n\nHere are 7 signs your company actually runs on data:\n\n1. Someone Owns Data Quality\n\n- Data isn’t just “available”—it’s trusted\n- There’s a clear owner ensuring clean, accurate data\n\nPro-Tip: Assign a dedicated leader to data governance. If no one is responsible, everyone is guessing.\n\n2. New Projects Start With a Data Plan\n\n- Data collection is considered before the first line of code\n- Performance tracking is built into launches from day one\n\nPro-Tip: Make data planning mandatory in project kickoffs. If it’s an afterthought, you’ll always be playing catch-up.\n\n3. Opinions Come With Numbers\n\n- People naturally back up their ideas with data\n- The phrase “Where’s the data?” is part of daily discussions\n\nPro-Tip: Normalize data-backed decision-making. If gut feelings drive key choices, you’re not data-driven.\n\n4. Bad Numbers Aren’t Hidden\n\n- Underperformance isn’t ignored—it’s analyzed\n- Data is used to improve, not to blame\n\nPro-Tip: Encourage transparency. If teams fear sharing bad results, they’ll manipulate data instead of fixing problems.\n\n5. Everyone Can Access Relevant Data\n\n- Teams don’t need to “ask IT” for key reports\n- Employees can quickly pull insights related to their work\n\nPro-Tip: Invest in self-service analytics. If data is locked away, it’s useless.\n\n6. Every Goal Has a Measurable Target\n\n- Objectives come with clear KPIs, not vague aspirations\n- Success is measured, not assumed\n\nPro-Tip: Tie every strategic goal to a specific metric. If you can’t measure it, you won’t improve it.\n\n7. Data Training Is a Priority\n\n- Employees know how to interpret and use data\n- Data literacy is seen as a core skill, not an “extra”\n\nPro-Tip: Provide ongoing data education. If only the analysts understand data, your company isn’t truly data-driven.\n\nData-driven isn’t a claim. It’s a culture.\n\nAnd if your company isn’t there yet… it’s time to make a change.\n\n\nEnjoy this?\n\nFollowfor tips on GenAI adoption, data engineering, and leadership.",

So I asked myself:\n\n If I could only get one thing done today, what would it be?\n\nThat simple question changed everything.\n\n It forced me to focus.\n It cut out distractions.\n It made my actions matter.\n\nAnd guess what? The more I prioritized the right things, the more impact I had.\n\nLook, we’re all human. We forget things. We have days where we stare at our to-do list and think, \"Nope. Not today.\" But when we have structure—just enough to keep us moving but not enough to make us feel trapped—it creates freedom.\n\n Freedom to serve more people.\n Freedom to scale our business.\n Freedom to actually enjoy the process.\n\nSo today, instead of trying to do everything, ask yourself:\n\n What’s the one thing that absolutely has to get done?\n\nThen go do it.\n\nWhat’s your One Thing today?\n\nI’d love to hear it!",

During university, I had a few jobs as a programmer or system administrator, but after university, I wanted to work only in IT security (cyber security was not a common term at that time), so all\nthe full-time jobs on my CV relate to that field.\n\nℹ️ What is the most appealing thing to you about working in cyber security?\n\nI love the intellectual challenge and the constant change. I like to solve problems, analyze complex systems and scenarios and learn new things all the time. Some people get their adrenaline boost from physical activities and I get mine from mental exercise.\n\n Name a book/movie that has inspired you. Anything specific to cyber security that you would recommend?\n\n“Ada, the Enchantress of Numbers: Prophet of the Computer Age” by Betty Alexandra Toole\n\n I recommend you to follow her , like and comment on this post to share her example, and perhaps suggest others to showcase !\n\n>>> This profile is part of a series I’m publishing every other day in collaboration with @Women4Cyber Foundation, follow me to receive the next updates.",

Disengaged, cautious, and resistant to change.\n\nSo, what makes the difference?\n\nI can tell—almost immediately—when a practice has a high-performing team:\n\n Staff show up energised and full of ideas\n There’s a genuine sense of teamwork and shared purpose\n Conversations focus on better patient outcomes\n Leaders ask questions, listen, and encourage\n\nAnd then, there are the teams where something feels… off.\n\n Staff seem on edge or unusually quiet\n Leaders do most of the talking (or worse—directing)\n There’s a lack of collaboration or ownership\n High staff turnover is common\n\nSo, what’s the real secret to transforming these struggling teams?\n\nGreat Leaders Aren’t Born—They’re Developed\nMany managers step into leadership without structured training. I was one of them.\n\nEarly in my career, I was promoted into management with little guidance. I struggled. It wasn’t until I asked for help, enroled in coaching, and committed to learning leadership skills that everything changed.\n\nWithin 12 months, I went from failing manager to leading an award-winning, high-performing team.\n\n Every leader has blind spots (it’s part of being human)\n Self-awareness is the key to unlocking leadership potential\n With the right training, culture and performance transform\n\nThe Secret? Psychological Safety \n\nIf there’s one defining characteristic of high-performing teams, it’s this:\n\n Team members feel comfortable (safe) sharing their ideas and asking questions. They also take calculated risks—without fear of embarrassment or punishment.\n\nThis is psychological safety, and it’s the foundation of collaboration, innovation, and strong leadership.\n\nWhen leaders create a safe, open environment, teams become:\n️ More engaged\n️ More Innovative\n️ More committed to a shared purpose\n\nBut when people fear speaking up, performance plummets, stress rises, and turnover skyrockets.\n\nHow to Build Psychological Safety\n Start with Clarity – Define your team’s purpose and values.\n\n Listen More, Talk Less – Great leaders ask more questions than they answer.\n Encourage Ideas – Every voice matters. Create space for innovation.\n Build Trust – Be transparent, show empathy, and recognize contributions.\n\nIf your culture isn’t producing the results you need… let’s talk.\n\nEveryone has untapped potential.\n\nIf you feel your team could benefit from a more collaborative, empowered, and engaged culture, let’s connect.\n\n Drop me a message or comment below—I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

But here’s the truth: AI enhances it.\n\n️Step 1: Train ChatGPT to understand your business\n\nBefore generating content, I ensure ChatGPT knows:\n→My audience\n→Their pain points (scaling, efficiency, AI adoption fears)\n→My brand’s voice & expertise\n\nHow? I train it with:\n→ My LinkedIn engagement data to analyse what resonates\n→ My company website to align messaging\n→ A simple prompt: \"Act as a LinkedIn brand-building expert. Ask me questions to define my audience and key pain points.\"\n\n️Step 2: Follow a high-impact post structure\n\nAfter testing formats, this one delivers consistently:\n→Hook: Start with a bold statement that grabs attention.\n→Problem: Address a key challenge your audience faces.\n→Insights: Provide clear, actionable solutions.\n→CTA: Prompt engagement or direct outreach.\n\n️ Step 3: Analyze & refine with AI\n\nYour job doesn’t end after posting. AI helps track & optimize:\n→Which posts get the most engagement?\n→When is my audience most active?\n→What topics perform best?\n\nTry prompts like:\n“Analyze this LinkedIn post’s performance and suggest improvements.”\n“Rewrite my next post to match my highest-performing content.”\n\nAI is a tool, but strategy is key.\nThe best results come from leveraging AI while adding your unique expertise.\n\nHow are you adapting to AI in your work? Are you embracing the change or still figuring it out?\n\nDM me or book your free strategy call in our website.",

A tech giant adjusts ethics to match market realities. The surprise isn't that they dropped the pledge - it's that they managed to keep it for 5 years. In a free market, ethical self-restriction is a competitive disadvantage - your competitors won't hesitate while you play nice.\n\nI'm against it, but let's be honest - this was inevitable.\n\nSome context:\n️ 2018: Google creates AI principles after Project Maven controversy\n️ 2025: Principles shift from social impact focus to risk/benefit analysis\n\n The interesting part? Most big tech companies never made similar commitments. The standard was always more... flexible.\n\nFrom my perspective, this highlights growing tension between:\n🇪🇺 European-style regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, in force since 2 Feb 2025)\n🇺🇸 Silicon Valley's \"move fast\" approach with Trump revoking executive order on AI risks\n🇨🇳 Rising geopolitical tech competition, exemplified by China's Trojan horse tactics with open sourcing DeepSeerk R1 model\n\nThe real question for us builders and engineers: How do you see this impacting global AI development standards? Particularly, with the EU AI Act coming into force this month.\n\nSources, including coverage of Trump's AI order revocation and DeepSeerk R1 analysis in comments ⬇️",

See a quick summary below, or find the full preprint here:.\n\nIn my work and in the Neural Interfacing Lab at,, we are interested in decoding behavior from brain-wide recordings, particularly movement in my case. We work together with participants implanted with sEEG electrodes allowing us to record neural activity throughout the brain.\n\nIn previous work, we described how movement can be decoded from brain-wide neural activity, across tasks and across participants. However, this was only decoding between move and rest, so naturally we wanted to know more about the neural content of these brain-wide dynamics.\n\nTo investigate, we recorded 3D hand movement trajectory while our participants played a custom made game where the goal was to move a pufferfish to a bubble to pop it. From the trajectories, we retrieved position, velocity, speed and acceleration. At the same time, we recorded neural activity from cortical and sub-cortical brain areas.\n\nWe extracted low frequency activity (< 5 HZ), mid frequency power (8 - 30 Hz) and high-frequency power (55 - 200 Hz), windowed the data (300ms length, 50ms shift), and used preferential subspace identification (PSID) to decode 12 kinematics.\n\nWe found that non-directional hand movement speed can be decoded using low, mid and high frequency information. Particularly, the low frequency activity reached substantial decoding performance (up to 0.76 + 0.03). Decoding directional components was a much bigger challenge for the decoder.\n\nIf we look at the electrode contact locations that were significantly correlated with hand movement speed, we observe that these contacts are located throughout the brain, including cortical and subcortical structures.\n\nAbout the decoding of the directional kinematics. It turns out that if we change the reference frame from the sensor to the goal, that the decoder becomes able to decode position w.r.t. the target above chance! It suggests that the brain represents goal-directed movement in relationship to that goal.\n\nOverall, the decoder reached the highest performance using low frequency activity. The phase information is important, as the performance was substantially lower when we used the power. This neural signal shares similarities with the local motor potential described in the motor cortex.\n\nOur results provide a comprehensive overview of the decodable movement-related information in brain-wide neural activity, and strengthen our previous results that the whole brain may be involved in generating movement.\n\nWe are excited about this work and hope you enjoy reading it. As we always do in our lab, we share code and data publicly. Please find the code here:.",

Vance, le vice-Premier ministre chinois Zhang Guoqing, mais surtout Sundar Pichai (Google), Brad Smith (Microsoft) et Sam Altman de ChatGPT et peut être Elon Musk et les fondateurs de DeepSeek, en plus bien sûr de nos champions français de Mistral, DS, polytechnique, des fonds d’investissement. The Place to be dans le monde de l’Ia !\n\nQuelques news importantes :\n\n les Émirats arabes en partenariat avec notre pays vont construire un data center géant en France donc ! Il sera intégré à un immense campus dédié à l’IA\n\n De la sorte, la France reste dans la course à l’intelligence artificielle avec cet investissement de mammouth, grâce à des capitaux étrangers\n\n L’investissement représente 30 à 50 milliards d’euros selon l’Élysée.\n\n D’une capacité de calcul allant jusqu’à un gigawatt, ce sera une pointure maximum du secteur\n\n L’endroit qui accueillera doit encore être défini. La ministre française de l’IAétudie 35 sites d’environ 1 200 hectares\n\n Ce sommet permet également à la France de rester dans la course à l’innovation avec cette place très importante qu’elle a su prendre dans les décisions au sujet de l’IA. Avec des investissements aussi massifs nous prenons le bon virage !\n\nLa présence des entreprises les plus influentes dans le secteur, des décisionnaires, les plus importantes du monde, des investisseurs, les plus importants du monde en dit très long sur notre positionnement stratégique.\n\n️ Oui la France compte très fort dans le secteur. Et c’est une super nouvelle.\n\nSi en plus on peut avoir une approche responsable et écologique pour faire avancer le tout ce sera un gros 10/10. Il faudra aussi que la France reste maître du système et de ses règles sans donner les clés au payeur.\n\n\n\n\n Et si vous souhaitez prendre rendez-vous (avec un humain encore, mais jusqu’à quand? pour discuter des possibilités d’investir dans le secteur c’est par ici ",

Couple that with the marketing folks being unable to articulate what they need and why in the mathematical form required by finance.

        "content": "Micromanagement doesn’t improve performance.\n\nIt drives your best people away.\n\nIt's not just shouting or threats - it's often subtle, unintentional behaviours that create uncertainty, anxiety, and disengagement.\n\nHere are 8 common fear-based behaviours leaders might display - and how to fix them:\n\n 1. Unclear expectations.\nYour team feels like they’re guessing what success looks like, leaving them unsure and anxious.\n\n Set clear, measurable goals.\nDefine what success looks like for every project. Use regular check-ins to ensure alignment and clarity.\n\n 2. Imposing unnecessary urgency.\nFake deadlines or piling on “emergency” tasks might seem like driving results, but it breeds stress and burnout.\n\n Align urgency with priorities.\nExplain why deadlines matter and connect them to business goals. Ensure the workload is realistic.\n\n 3. Using vague or critical feedback.\nStatements like “We need to talk about your performance” without explanation leave employees fearful and defensive.\n\n Offer actionable feedback.\nUse a constructive approach: “Here’s what’s working, here’s where improvement is needed, and here’s how I’ll support you.”\n\n 4. Micromanaging tasks.\nStepping in to “fix” things or taking over sends the message that you don’t trust your team.\n\n Delegate and empower.\nGive your team ownership of tasks and let them find solutions, even if it means learning through mistakes.\n\n 5. Ignoring achievements.\nFocusing only on mistakes and what’s not working demotivates your team over time.\n\n Celebrate wins regularly.\nRecognise successes - big or small. Regular appreciation builds confidence and encourages better performance.\n\n 6. Keeping your team in the dark.\nWhen employees don’t have visibility into decisions or changes, it creates uncertainty and mistrust.\n\n Be transparent.\nCommunicate openly about decisions, changes, and challenges. Transparency builds trust and loyalty.\n\n 7. Creating fear around job security.\nSaying things like, “Many people would love to have your role,” fosters a toxic, competitive environment.\n\n Provide reassurance and growth paths.\nFocus on development: “Here’s how we can work together to build your skills and grow your career.”\n\n 8. Treating performance reviews as threats.\nUsing appraisals as punishment creates fear instead of driving improvement.\n\n Turn reviews into coaching opportunities.\nUse performance reviews to discuss growth, strengths, and opportunities for the future—not as a disciplinary tool.\n\nFear doesn’t lead to excellence - trust does.\n\nThe best leaders create environments where their teams feel supported, safe, and empowered to innovate and grow.\n\nWhat’s one leadership habit you’re improving right now?\n Repost to inspire more empowered workplaces.\n Follow me, Jen Blandos, for daily insights on leadership, business, and workplace wellbeing.",

We use task queues in's CRM.\n\nSidenote:\nStartups should not use Salesforce.\nHubspot is easier, less expensive, and more connected.\n\nTask queues group tasks together.\n\nI have a queue for each meeting in's sales process.\n\nI have a basic task queue structure:\n1. book - I need to book the meeting\n2. prep - Meeting is booked and need to be ready for it\n3. held/review - Meeting was held, next steps require some thought and/or purpose of the meeting wasn't accomplished\n\n\n2. I create task queue views.\n\nThe views show me all deals with tasks in that queue.\n\nSo simple to run through a bunch of similar tasks.\n\n\n\n3. Task execution flow.\n\nHubspot has a really cool screen dedicated to getting tasks done.\n\nI only do followup tasks during certain time blocks of the week.\n\nI go to the view of a queue and then start the tasks.\n\nThe UI of the execution flow helps me stay focused and mow 'em down.\n\n\n\n4. Time blocking.\n\nI have blocks for doing \"office work\" on Monday morning, Wed all day, Thurs morning, and Friday afternoon.\n\nI always feel like I'm running around completely unfocused without time blocks.\n\n\n\n️ Consider reposting to share how to stay on top of a lot of deals.\n\n Do you use tasks in your CRM? No...like actually use them?",

        "content": "Musharakah in Action: How Banks Fuel Growth Through Ethical Partnerships\nIn our last post, we saw how Musharakah helped Ahmed and Khalid turn a simple bakery into a thriving business. But did you know that banks also use Musharakah to fund businesses while staying Shari’ah-compliant?\n\nLet’s explore the two key types of Musharakah—Shirkat-ul-Milk and Shirkat-ul-Aqd—and see how they shape financial partnerships.\n\n1. Shirkat-ul-Milk: Ownership-Based Partnership\nThis type of Musharakah happens when two or more people jointly own an asset, either by choice or by circumstance.\n\n Example: Ayesha and Zaid inherit a commercial property. Instead of selling it, they rent it out and share the rental income. This is Shirkat-ul-Milk in action!\nBut Musharakah isn’t just about co-owning properties—it plays a vital role in banking too!\n\n2. Shirkat-ul-Aqd: Business-Based Partnership\nThis is the true essence of Musharakah in Islamic banking, where partners pool capital, expertise, or resources for a business venture.\n\n Example: A startup needs funding, and an Islamic bank steps in, forming a Musharakah agreement. The bank provides capital, while the entrepreneurs contribute their skills. Profits are shared based on a pre-agreed ratio, and any loss is borne according to capital contribution.\n\nHow Banks Apply Musharakah\n\n Musharakah Financing: Instead of interest-based loans, banks invest in businesses, sharing profits and risks.\n\n Home Financing: The bank and the customer jointly purchase a house, with the customer gradually buying the bank’s share.\n\n Agricultural & SME Growth: Farmers and small businesses get direct investment rather than debt, fostering sustainable expansion.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\n Risk-sharing builds trust and fairness.\n Entrepreneurs get real support, not just loans.\n Banking becomes a tool for growth, not just profit.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nIn our next post, we’ll dive into Mudarabah, another fascinating Islamic finance model that fuels businesses while keeping risk and reward balanced. Stay tuned!\n\n Have you seen Musharakah in action? Would you prefer a profit-sharing model over traditional loans? Let’s discuss in the comments!",

Own your routine\n- Without a plan, you’ll follow someone else’s.\n- Design a structure that aligns with your goals.\n- Build habits that move you forward, not hold you back.\n\n2. Break the comfort cycle\n- The easy path leads nowhere.\n- Growth requires discomfort.\n- Choose challenge over convenience.\n\n3. Train your mind like a muscle\n- Strength isn’t just physical, it’s mental.\n- Master the art of focus and discipline.\n- Your future depends on what you do daily.\n\n4. Cut the noise\n- Not everything deserves your attention.\n- Filter out distractions that don’t serve you.\n- Energy wasted on the wrong things is energy lost forever.\n\n5. Build momentum through action\n- Small wins create big shifts.\n- Progress compounds over time.\n- Start today, no matter how small the step.\n\n6. Adapt and evolve\n- Stagnation is the real failure.\n- The best routines adjust as you grow.\n- Stay flexible, but stay committed.\n\n7. Define success on your terms\n- Stop living by someone else’s script.\n- Own your choices, your habits, your results.\n- The life you want is built by the actions you take.\n\nMost people drift.\nThey wake up and follow the same patterns.\nPatterns they are given by others.\n\nIf you don’t take charge of your habits..\nSomeone else will.\n\nIf you don’t create your own routine..\nYou’ll live by one designed for you.\n\nOwn them. Shape them. Align them.\n\n---\n\nP.S. – This image is copyrighted. Please ask for permission before using it.\n\nRepost ️ if you find this useful.\nHit the  if you enjoy my content.",

Or simply let your mind wander, it’s amazing what clarity comes when you give your thoughts space.\n\nAs a rule - not looking mindlessly at the phone during a conversation and if I absolutely must, asking the other person’s permission to attend to something because it’s urgent.\n\nBreaking the habit of mindless scrolling doesn’t happen overnight, but it starts with small, intentional choices.\n\nImagine reclaiming those moments, not as gaps to fill, but as opportunities to reconnect with yourself, people and the world around you.\n\nBecause some gaps are meant to be enjoyed.",

        "content": " Asking Is Not Selling  Entrepreneur perspective. \n\nIn the popular imagination, entrepreneurs are the consummate salespeople.\n\nThey are individuals with a compelling vision, equipped with the communication skills and forceful personalities that get others to “buy” into their ideas.\n\nHowever, true entrepreneurship is not just about selling a vision, it’s about co-creating one. It’s about building relationships, fostering trust, and forming mutually beneficial partnerships that drive long-term success.\n\nRobert Cialdini, in his book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, explores the science behind persuasion and the subtle yet powerful ways in which people are influenced. He identifies six key principles that shape human behavior:\n Social Proof – People follow the actions of others, assuming that widespread behavior is the correct one.\n Authority – Individuals are more likely to trust and obey those in positions of perceived expertise.\n Liking – We are more easily persuaded by people we like and relate to.\n Scarcity – The less available something seems, the more desirable it becomes.\n Reciprocation – A favor given often compels a favor in return, creating a cycle of mutual exchange.\n Commitment & Consistency – Once a person commits to something, they strive to act in ways that align with that commitment.\n\n(good book/read btw - my recommendation)\n\nThese principles don’t just apply to sales, they define how we influence, lead, and collaborate. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a leader, or a professional in any field, the key to long-term influence isn’t about convincing people to “buy” into your ideas. It’s about creating shared value, aligning goals, and fostering relationships that make persuasion feel natural rather than forced. Influence is not about manipulation, it’s about meaningful connection.\n\n\n\n\nHow do you use these principles in your work? Let’s discuss.",

This project highlights how machine learning can optimize inventory management, pricing, and marketing strategies.\n\nThe dataset contained multiple product and store-related features, including Item Weight, Item MRP, Outlet Size, Location Type, and Store Type. The challenge was to handle missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection for accurate sales prediction.\n\n️ Key Steps in the Project:\n Data Preprocessing: Filled missing values, standardized categories, and applied label encoding.\n Feature Engineering: Selected relevant features affecting sales.\n Model Implementation: Trained an XGBoost Regressor to predict sales.\n Evaluation: Achieved 87.59% R² on training data and 50.60% R² on test data.\n\n Results & Takeaways:\n️ The model performed well on training data but showed signs of overfitting on test data.\n️ Feature importance analysis can help optimize sales strategies.\n️ Future improvements: Hyperparameter tuning, feature scaling, and testing other models like Random Forest and Linear Regression.\n\nRetailers can leverage machine learning to optimize stock, adjust pricing, and improve customer satisfaction.

Here’s why:\n\n Most people watching have no clue what ChatGPT is.\n Even fewer know what the black circle means.\n\nA Super Bowl ad is prime real estate for top-of-funnel awareness. You have millions of new eyeballs—people who might have never heard of you before—ready to listen.\n\nSo why go cryptic?\n\nMost brands go big with:\n Celeb cameos\n Humor\n A clear, memorable message\n\nSomething that makes you remember them and brings up conversations at work the next day.\n\nInstead, OpenAI’s ad left most people saying:\n “What was that dot thing about?”\n\nAI is still a niche bubble—this ad didn’t break through. It just left people scratching their heads.\n\nWhat do you think? Marketing win or wasted millions? ⬇️",

Kindness is a certain type of strength.”\n\n~Jim Rohn ~\n\nWhen we display kindness, it often comes from a place of compassion and strength, not a lack of it.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s a persistent misconception that equates these acts of generosity and concern for others with weakness. This misunderstanding may stem from a variety of societal and psychological factors, and it’s important to recognize why this view is not only erroneous but also harmful.\n\nKindness is indeed a form of strength that requires resilience and a strong sense of self-worth to give of oneself without expecting anything in return.\n\nBy continuing to be kind, even in the face of skepticism, you embody the real essence of strength, which often goes beyond mere physical or assertive powers.\n\nKindness is STRENGTH… Courtesy is POWER…",
