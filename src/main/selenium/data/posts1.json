      "content": "On Thursday, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) strongly opposed the leading restaurant aggregators Zomato and Swiggy entering private-label food delivery through their quick-commerce platforms.\n\nThe NRAI charged Zomato and Swiggy with leveraging their dominant market positions and access to restaurant data to introduce private-label food products directly or through subsidiaries like Blinkit Bistro and Swiggy Cafe/SNACC.\n\n“Zomato and Swiggy, originally established as marketplace platforms, are now leveraging their dominant positions and access to restaurant data to venture into private-label food delivery either directly or via their subsidiary,” the NRAI disclosed, adding that it raises legal concerns under the Copyright Act and associated laws.\n\n“This strategy not only cannibalises the business of restaurants that rely on these platforms but also raises serious concerns under the Copyright Act and related laws,” the association added.\n\nNRAI President and Wow Momo! CEO Sagar Daryani said disapprovingly, “We were always given verbal assurances by the aggregators that they would never resort to private labelling. This is a breach of trust.”\n\nMoreover, he pointed out the issue of consumer masking, stressing that restaurants do not have access to customer data collected by the aggregators.\n\nThe NRAI, representing over five lakh restaurants in India, stated that this move breaches marketplace neutrality and impairs fair competition, creating a significant threat to the survival of restaurants nationwide.\n\nThe industry body further noted that Zomato and Swiggy exploited data derived from restaurant partners while launching competing products, creating a conflict of interest.\n\nDaryani affirmed that the NRAI is “absolutely not okay” with this development, declaring the industry body would seek legal remedies while approaching regulatory authorities.\n\nWith the restaurant industry valued at Rs 5.69 lakh crore, the NRAI has urged restaurants, customers and regulators to work together and maintain ethical practices in the competitive food delivery space.",

This decision highlights a disturbing trend where profits are prioritized over people. Employees are the backbone of any organization, and treating them as expendable undermines their immense contribution to a company’s success. Did the management consider the families who depend on these employees? In a country like India, where social security is minimal, such actions leave people vulnerable, with no safety net to fall back on. The government must step in immediately to address this issue and hold companies accountable for the well-being of their workforce. Organizations must realize that their true strength lies in their employees, not just in profits. It's time to put people first.",

Those who take advantage of every leave in their HR policy (this is 90% of people).\n\n2. Those who think they’ll impress their boss and take as few leaves as possible.\n\nIf you’re in the 2nd category, I’m here to tell you that you’re doing it all wrong.\n\nFirstly, most Indian companies give the bare minimum leave allowance - the least you need for your mental health.\n\nAnd skipping even those leaves doesn’t make you a better employee. It makes you a more exhausted one.\n\nAs a doctor, I’ve seen how chronic stress manifests in patients:\n\n- Insomnia\n- Fatigue\n- Burnout\n\nThe human body isn’t designed for constant output.\n\nAnd mental reset grants you superpowers like:\n\n- 40% more creativity\n- A stronger immune system\n- Higher emotional resilience\n- And a higher life expectancy\n\nSo please, don’t make the same mistake in 2025.\n\nBlock those leaves. Plan a trip. Or just stay home and sleep in.\n\nBecause when you take care of yourself, you’re not ‘slacking off’ — you’re investing in your long-term health, happiness, AND productivity.\n\nSo it’s good for your mind, body and career.\n\nFound this impactful?

      "content": "I don’t hire developers by looking at how green their GitHub graph is and here’s why…\n\nA greener GitHub contribution graph doesn’t mean higher skills or deeper expertise.\n\nLet me tell you why:\n\n1. Many teams use private repositories like Bitbucket or internal tools. Everything is mostly private. If they could show those commits, their graph would be green every day.\n\n2. Students and junior developers often use GitHub to showcase their projects, challenges, or learning milestones.\n\nThat’s great, but it doesn’t automatically mean they’re “better” than someone with a gray graph who’s been solving real-world problems for years.\n\n3. git commits can be backdated or faked. A few commands and your GitHub can look like you’ve been coding non-stop for years. Does that show skill? No.\n\n4.A graph won’t tell me how you debug tough issues, work with a team, or handle edge cases in production.\n\nWhat actually matters to me?\n\n- Your problem-solving skills. Can you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code?\n- Your mindset. Are you curious and eager to learn?\n- Your collaboration. Can you work with others to build great software?\n- Your impact. Do you understand the \"why\" behind what you're building?\n\nGreen graphs are cool to look at, but they’re not the full story.\n\nAnd developers, if your GitHub isn’t “green enough,” don’t let that hold you back.\n\nFocus on building great things, public or private.\n\nWhat do you think? Do green graphs matter in hiring? Let me know below!",
