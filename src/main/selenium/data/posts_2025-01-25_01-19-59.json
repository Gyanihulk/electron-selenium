Hey we got alast year too!\n\nI’ll admit, there is something about an arcade that’s adult-welcoming.\n\nRight now my kids are playing games I’m admittedly over-paying for. If they play enough we will experience the modern day alchemy of turning $100 cash into $10 of plastic toys from China.\n\nBut this place does it right. Clean, well lit, big bar, real food, tons of places to watch sports, and every game the kids like to play.\n\nRetail isn’t dead- it’s just transformed-\n\nThis isn’t.",

Could you truly solve in the moment with creativity and nimbleness without giving up, or asking Siri to weigh in as well? Challenge yourself to really think about ways to handle such a simple scenario without borrowing from a neighbor or running out and buying what you think you need.\n\nAnd here's the bigger question, could those reporting to you figure out ways to handle the situation without asking for advice from you, others, or the Internet?\n\nNow think of day to day problems that come up all of the time in the line of work you are in - how do you and your team navigate? Are you confident and empowered to solve what needs to be solved? What could be different or better?",

We scared all the silence away too, and the reactions take on different forms of noise, often in ways that we do not anticipate.\n\nIf we had considered it as a shared responsibility and treated other living beings as fellow travelers on this planet, the pains of today wouldn't be so much.\n\nWhen we understand that our actions have far-reaching consequences, we start working towards creating a world where every being has the space and freedom to thrive, and where the balance of nature is maintained.\n\nAchieving that begins with awareness of how our everyday decisions affect the environment and a promise to do better for ourselves and for the generations that will come after us.",

It was an exceptional opportunity to learn from some of the most inspiring researchers and practitioners in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.\nEach speaker shared invaluable insights that broadened my understanding and encouraged me to think more critically about the challenges in this field:\n\nProf. Dr.Sir, Professor-in-charge SCAN, for his visionary leadership and dedication to fostering collaboration in neurodegenerative research.\n\nDr. Sangeeta Ravat Ma'am (KEM Hospital, Mumbai), for her expertise in clinical diagnostics and strategies for patient care.\n\nProf.Ma'am (TIFR, Mumbai), for her enlightening talk on fundamental neuroscience and its role in understanding brain disorders.\n\nProf.Sir (IIT Madras), for his innovative work in assistive technologies to improve patient outcomes.\n\nProf. Rishikesh Narayanan Sir (IISc, Bangalore), for his contributions to advancing our understanding of neural networks and mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.\n\nProf. T.V. Sekher Sir (IIPS, Mumbai), for his valuable perspective on public health and the societal impact of aging and dementia.\n\nMs.Ma'am (Dementia in India Alliance, Bangalore), for her inspiring advocacy and work in dementia care across India.\n\nDr. Amitabha Majumdar Sir (NCCS, Pune), for his impactful research into the cellular and molecular biology of neurodegeneration.\n\nProf. Dr.Sir (IIT Bombay), for his pioneering contributions to diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic advancements.\n\nThe discussions ranged across diverse topics such as biomarkers, clinical diagnostics, neuropsychology, palliative care, and fundamental neuroscience, each of which was thoughtfully explored. I came away with a wealth of knowledge and a deep sense of inspiration.\n\nI am sincerely thankful to Prof.Sir and the entireteam for organizing such a meaningful event and creating a space for collaboration and learning. The efforts of all the speakers and researchers are paving the way for breakthroughs that hold immense promise for the future.\nI look forward to applying the knowledge I have gained and contributing to this critical field in whatever way I can.",

      "content": "“Can we get 2 additional licenses for free? It doesn’t cost you anything.”\n\nThis is a sentence SaaS companies hear often, and it highlights a common misunderstanding about the cost structure of SaaS products. Here’s why this request is problematic:\n\n1. Perceived vs. Actual Costs:\nWhile SaaS products operate in the cloud, and there’s no physical product involved, additional licenses still incur indirect costs. For instance, more users might increase server load, customer support demands, or other operational expenses. Even if marginal costs are low, resources like maintenance, infrastructure, and scalability all play a role.\n\n2. Value vs. Cost:\nLicenses aren’t priced purely based on cost to the company; they’re priced based on the value the software delivers to the customer. Granting free licenses diminishes the perceived value of the product and sets a precedent for discount expectations.\n\n3. Scalability and Fairness:\nIf SaaS companies start handing out additional licenses for free to every customer who asks, it would disrupt their revenue model. Customers paying full price for their licenses might see this as unfair, leading to dissatisfaction or churn.\n\n4. Long-Term Support Implications:\nEvery additional license represents another user that may require training, onboarding, and support. These resources aren’t free, even if the software is already built.\n\n5. Addressing the Mindset:\nCustomers often see SaaS as an infinite resource because it’s digital. Educating users about why licenses are priced as they are—and the broader value SaaS products deliver—can help bridge this gap in understanding.",
