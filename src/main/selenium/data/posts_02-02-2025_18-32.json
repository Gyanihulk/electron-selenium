        "content": "Simple living is a virtue lauded by thinkers since time immemorial. This virtue was mocked as primitive with the spread of the modern culture of lifestyle products, wherein people equated possession of state-of-the-art luxuries with success. While wealth has always been flaunted as a marker of success, most modern luxuries were unprecedented in the ecological destruction that went into making them.\n\nConsequently, simplicity seems to have made a comeback of sorts, at least among environmentally conscious people. Two centuries of untrammelled industrialization and unfettered commercialization have devastated our ecosystem, thereby making a movement towards simplicity not just desirable but even essential. Simplicity offers the joys of calmness and clarity that come about when we are not constantly titillated by myriad sensual stimulations.\n\nHowever, given the overall materialism of our age, many still believe that gratifying the senses is life’s prime necessity (Bhagavad-gita 16.11). For them, decreasing luxuries seems like an appallingly anti-progressive idea. Without constant sensual stimulation, they feel utterly bored, as if they have nothing to live for. That’s why, despite nominally acknowledging the importance of simplicity, many people prefer luxury for themselves whenever they can get it.",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

        "content": "Last week Open AI released “Operator,” an assistant designed to carry out a wide variety of web tasks that will first be made available for ChatGPT Pro users. As we are exploring different agent models right now at Meahana, I was curious at how well it take a set of instructions and carry out even complex tasks.\n\nAfter you type in a prompt, it opens up a virtual machine and web browser to get to work.\n\nExperiment 1 - I prompted it \"build me a session on the Meahana platform where a group of individuals will brainstorm a list of marketing ideas, then prioritize the top, and build some action items for top ideas.\" It first searched the internet, found Meahana, asked me for my login (which I took over to enter). Once complete, I was very impressed with how it added three different activities from our template catalog, asking for my validation during the process and even figured out how to configure items to flow from one activity to the next. It handled all of this - getting confused only once. It even added facilitator notes! As a founder, it was fun watching a machine, with no training, try to interpret my instructions and follow the process it takes to build on software we've developed.\n\nExperiment 2 - was a bit of a fail. I prompted \"please take this figma mockup of the Meahana landing page, login to my webflow account and create the new page.\" I assumed this would be more straightforward of a task as it is done everyday. The operator kept searching for prebuilt template layouts, couldn't find what it needed, searched the web for more, gave up, then went back to Webflow to build it from scratch. It looked like a kid banging on a piano, just adding random div blocks, formatting and unformatting them, styling and unstyling text. After 30 minutes of watching it adding and deleting ideas, I finally gave up watching.\n\nI know Operator (computer using agent) is best suited to do simple internet tasks, but its fun to see the possibilities. The AI agent technology that is being built at companies, including ours, will be trained on performing smaller sets of tasks across several specialized agents.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with Operator yet?",

And wow, it was a January to be dry in the world of social media.\n\nI wouldn’t classify myself as a big drinker in terms of frequency or volume these days.\n\nI’m in my late 30s, I have 2 businesses, and 2 young kids. My big nights out are out are long gone.\n\nBut like all people, sometimes I have a day. Or in the case of January, an unrelenting torrent of bullsh*t from the biggest social media platforms in the world. Platform shutdowns, political panic, sudden metric deprecations, and APIs just plain not working.\n\nAnd after one of those days, well, . All better.\n\nI think the biggest thing I’ve learned in my relationship with alcohol is it shrinks my battery. And I need that energy tomorrow (I mentioned the small kids, right?).\n\nIn terms of the result, I feel great!\n\nNoticable differences:\n\n Better sleep. I average 6 hours. It’s not enough. Making that better quality 1-2 nights a week is huge for me.\n\n Less inflammation, especially in my hands. I type all day, family history of arthritis, and it was single digit low temperatures in Philadelphia much of January.\n\n️ Lost some water weight. Down 6 lbs on the scale. I don’t notice a difference, but my wife says my face isn’t as puffy, so I’ll take the W.\n\n I’m thinking about alcohol less. Not that it preoccupied my thoughts, but at the end of a long day I find myself reflexively thinking more about the frozen grapes in the freezer or squeezing in some Call of Duty after the kids go to bed.\n\nI’m not a teetotaler, do your thing! But it was a great exercise and I highly recommend it.\n\nAs for me, I’m downgrading to special occasions.\n\nCheers to health! ",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

But I still remember how I landed my first client after pitching for 10 months on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.\n\nFor some, it’s 6 months.\n\nFor others, it’s 3 months—or even just 1 month.\n\nAnd a few lucky ones land their first client on Day 1.\n\nSo, why the difference?\n\nIn my opinion, the timeline doesn’t matter.\n\nWhat truly matters is what you do after you get your first client or project.\n\nBecause building relationships and delivering results is what creates long-term success in digital marketing.\nWhen I started, I focused on one main goal: giving real value.\n\nHere’s what worked for me:\n\nCommunicating clearly and consistently with the client.\n\nAsking smart questions to understand their goals and challenges.\n\nDelivering a campaign so effective that it led to glowing testimonials and repeat work.\n\nOne satisfied client became the foundation for referrals, reviews, and 150+ clients served.\n\nWhat I’d do now to land clients faster:\n\nIf I had to start all over again, here’s what I’d focus on to see results faster than 10 months:\n\n1- Your skillset\n\nLearn a lot (happened to be my best friend). Get as many certificates as you can (relevant to your field). Be so good that clients can’t ignore the value you deliver.\n\n2. Your communication\n\nBe clear, responsive, and proactive. Clients love marketers who make their lives easier.\n\n3. Your personal brand\n\nStart building your presence online. Share your insights, tips, and small wins to attract clients before pitching.\n\nIf you think you are walking slow, remember\nColonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, took 65 years to create his successful business.\n\nIn marketing, success comes from consistency, learning, and delivering value.\n\nStart today.\n\nStay focused.\n\nAnd don’t stop until you reach your goals.\n\nHow long did it take you to land your first client? Share your story below!\n\nP.S. Book a free consultation call (Link in bio), and let’s discuss how I can help you and your business boost conversions.",

This is caused by non-native speakers pronouncing said language’s phonemes different in a way that’s rooted in the non-native speaker’ languages’ cross-language phonetic differences. This study aims to describe phenomena like these that occur with native Turkish speakers’ pronunciation of English. The study was conducted with Turkish high-schoolers who had completed a preparatory year in English. They were asked to read 2 texts and a list of words while being recorded, these recordings were transcribed using the IPA and compared with the General American accented counterparts using the Levenshtein algorithm. Volunteer American high-schoolers in southern United States listened to and were surveyed about the recordings. The comprehension survey yielded results agreeing with the previous claims on the accent’s properties. As for the comprehensibility of Turkish-accented English, the answers claimed the accent to be mainly comprehensible.",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

The \"data blindspot\" trap\n↳ No analysis of what’s working.\n↳ Ignoring audience activity trends.\n↳ Refusing to pivot when needed.\n\n4.

Norbert and I have got you covered.\n\nLet's fix it, and there are only 4 ways to do it ↓\n\n1. Focus on value-first content.\n2. Know your audience deeply.\n3. Stay consistent and authentic.\n4.
