With anyone, it is helping them understand what is getting in their way of doing the activity, changing the behavior, or adjusting the mindset.\n\nThis episode is the start of a new series for you to learn about coaching and leading a team!\n\nYou can listen to the episode here \n\nGo grab a cocktail, a cigar and strap in for another great episode of Sales and Cigars.",

      "content": "One of the hardest things to master as a leader is finding the balance between celebrating progress and relentlessly striving for better.\n\nAnd this is more difficult than most people realize.\n\nLeaders are hardwired to look ahead.\n\nThey are constantly hunting for the next opportunity, pushing for innovation, and setting new performance benchmarks.\n\nIt is what makes them driven and ambitious, but sometimes, it is also what makes them miss the moment.\n\nI will be the first to admit, I struggle with this.\n\nAt work, I am always asking, \"What is next? How can we improve? Where is the next win?\"\n\nAnd while this mindset drives results, it can sometimes overlook an important reality: progress matters, and so does recognizing it.\n\nThis tendency does not just stay at the office.\n\nIt follows me home.\n\nMy family points it out all the time.\n\nIt’s hard for me to switch gears and detach from the instinct to set higher standards and aim for better outcomes.\n\nBut family is not the same as business.\n\nAnd honestly, neither is business all the time.\n\nLeaders need to make intentional efforts to pause, take a breath, and recognize progress, not just for themselves, but for their teams.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause being present and showing appreciation for the milestones, big or small, fuels motivation and reinforces a culture of achievement.\n\nWhen you acknowledge progress, you are not just patting people on the back.\n\nYou are showing them that their hard work matters and that they are moving the needle.\n\nHere is the takeaway from all of this:\n\nBeing results-driven is great, but do not let it come at the cost of being present.\n\nTake a moment to celebrate the progress, recognize the wins, and let your team (or your family) know that you see them.\n\nSo, ask yourself: When was the last time you acknowledged progress before moving on to the next goal?",
