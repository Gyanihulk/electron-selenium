      "content": "The overuse of AI-driven automation can collapse a few market segments. \n\nFor instance, the introduction of AI Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) capable of sending messages, emails, and making calls could potentially destroy outbound sales processes and SDR roles.\n\nAI SDRs are a short-term win for the sales team, but nobody likes to see 10s or 100s of sales emails or calls in the morning - no matter how creative your AI SDR is. It'll eventually end up as reported spam or in the trash, and AI SDRs will become useless.\n\nAI-driven automation will shine when it is a win-win, benefiting both the producer and customers rather than optimizing for one party (like AI SDRs).\n\nFor instance, Analysts are transitioning to an \"AI engineer\" on Cimba and delivering AI agents to amplify their impact by 100x. Now, businesses can automate multiple manual processes using those agents, and analysts are up-skilled to become \"AI Analyst Developers\" - it's a win-win.",

I get to blend strategy with execution, big-picture thinking paired with rolling up my sleeves to make it happen. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£     Customer-centricity is key. Product marketing is all about deeply understanding the customer. Diving into new industries has been seamless when I focus on listening and aligning with customer and company goals.\n\nPlus, it‚Äôs been fun to put myself in a fitness owner, adventure traveler or salesperson‚Äôs shoes to truly connect with their perspective.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£    Relationships matter. While I enjoy short-term projects, it‚Äôs the longer-term collaborations that truly stand out. Building and strengthening relationships with clients and teams is what makes the work so fulfilling.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£    Business development is a growth journey. Selling myself and finding new projects doesn‚Äôt come naturally (I‚Äôd much rather sell a product!). But I‚Äôve stepped out of my comfort zone, and it‚Äôs been rewarding to see the results of that effort.\n\n Got a project in mind? I have some space in March. Let‚Äôs connect.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£     Stay energized. Being a solo entrepreneur can feel isolating at times, so I‚Äôve learned the importance of carving out time for in-person interactions, whether it‚Äôs a walk, a coffee, or lunch with a friend. Those moments make all the difference.\n\nHere‚Äôs to growing, connecting, and walking into 2025 with purpose! \n\nWhat lessons did you learn this year?",
