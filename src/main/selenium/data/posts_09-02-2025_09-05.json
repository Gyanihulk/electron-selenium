No more \"putting butts in seats.\"\n- I stopped attending networking events, and focused more on my podcast.\n- If I didn't feel a \"Hell yes!\", I turned down speaking engagements.\n- Instead of working 50+ hours per week, I began working 5-10 hrs per week\n\nFrom a rational perspective, my business should have failed, right?\n\nQuite the opposite!\n\nThis picture was my 1st event of that year. Instead of 30-50 people in attendance, I had FIVE!\n\nBoth couples pictured were MEANT to be here.\nBoth couples became my clients, and it became my most profitable event of all time!\n\nThat year, I cut my speaking engagements down by 35%, my revenue doubled, and my profit 5x'ed!\n\n9 YEARS LATER....\n\n- I work about 25-30 hours per week\n- I presented less than 150 times last year (almost all virtual)\n- My revenue and profit grew by over 1500%.\n- And I'm so much happier!\n\nLesson - Listen to your intuition, even if others think you're crazy. And keep moving forward!",

        "content": "So yesterday, doing some research for PlayBooked I had the occasion to journey to New Orleans for some pre-Super Bowl events, including that at Brand Innovators at an amazing venue off the French Quarter.\n\nThank you,,for making that happen.\n\nNow, I am not going to the\non Sunday. That isn't the point here.\n\nFirst, I was astounded at the vibrant atmosphere of New Orleans. Post Katrina, there has been much said about the downfall of New Orleans. I haven't done much to dispel those conversations myself. I go there very sparingly, and don't do much to celebrate the city. But I was impressed by the atmosphere, the show of strength of the police and military (especially after the recent cowardly attack on tourists) and the overall feeling of being a part of something special. Streets were packed, restaurants were busy, and of course, even in the middle of the day, the bars were full.\n\nSecond, and we discuss this in the marketing world a lot, there really isn't anything like the energy in and around\nevents. In a world of highly fragmented avenues and white noise, it's near impossible for brands to reach an audience at scale. The energy and enthusiasm not just during the Super Bowl but in the entire week surrounding the event show that this isn't just a game. It isn't just a show. The closest comparison that I can make is that it is simply one of the world's largest trade shows.\n\nExcept in this\nthere isn't one focus. It's not just about this championship or this game or this sport, but about all sports. It's not about one industry but touches\nand\nand\nand\nand\nand much more. Oh, and I managed to miss the parties which I am sure is one of the main attractions for the C-Suite and the fans of both teams.\n\nGlad I was able to make it, and look forward to making this a regular occurance.",

Visionary Leadership: True leaders, like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, possess a powerful vision that \"telekinetically\" guides their companies. They inspire teams, attract talent, and drive innovation through the sheer force of their belief in a better future.\n2. Focused Intention: High-performing teams channel their energy towards specific goals, much like a telekinetic focusing their mental energy to achieve a desired outcome. This focus, often cultivated through mindfulness and goal-setting methodologies, drives efficiency and accelerates progress.\n3. Customer-Centricity: Understanding and anticipating customer needs is paramount. Successful businesses \"telekinetically\" sense customer desires, adapting products and services to meet evolving demands. This involves deep empathy, market research, and a relentless focus on customer feedback.\n4. Innovation through Focused Energy: Breakthrough innovations often emerge from a confluence of focused thought and creative energy. By fostering a culture of experimentation and encouraging out-of-the-box thinking, startups can \"telekinetically\" manifest novel solutions and disrupt existing markets.\n5. Teamwork as a Force Multiplier: High-performing teams leverage the combined energy and focus of their members, creating a powerful synergy that drives progress and achieves ambitious goals. This collective intention amplifies individual efforts, much like combining individual forces to achieve a greater outcome.\n\n Examples in Action:\n\n1. Tesla: Elon Musk's visionary leadership and unwavering belief in sustainable transportation have \"telekinetically\" driven the company's rapid growth and innovation.\n2. Airbnb: The platform's founders \"telekinetically\" envisioned a world where people could easily share their homes with travelers, disrupting the traditional hospitality industry.\n3. Google: The company's mission to \"organize the world's information and make it universally accessible\" has guided its development of innovative products like search, maps, and AI, shaping how we interact with the digital world.\n\nOur minds, the principles of focused intention, visionary leadership, and harnessing collective energy are fundamental to achieving success in business and entrepreneurship.

It’s Not Always About the Paycheck !\n\nYou might think a bigger salary or fancy perks are the secret to keeping your team happy, but the truth goes much deeper. Most employees leave not because of the money—but because of how they feel at work.\n\nLet’s uncover the REAL reasons behind the revolving door and how to fix them :\n\n Why They Leave :\n\n1️⃣ Toxic Work Culture: Negativity drains energy. People thrive where positivity flows.\n2️⃣ Micromanagement: Employees need trust and space to innovate—not someone watching their every move.\n3️⃣ Lack of Leadership: Without strong guidance, teams feel lost and disengaged.\n4️⃣ No Balance: Burnout happens when work eats into life. Flexibility shows respect .\n5️⃣ Feeling Undervalued: Fair pay and genuine appreciation go a long way .\n6️⃣ Invisible Efforts: Recognize and celebrate contributions—small or big .\n7️⃣ No Clear Direction: Ambiguity kills motivation. Clarity fuels productivity .\n8️⃣ Office Drama: Gossip and unresolved conflicts breed frustration. Open communication is key .\n9️⃣ No Growth Opportunities: If there’s no ladder to climb, they’ll look for one elsewhere .\n Zero Purpose: People want to contribute to something meaningful, not just clock in and out .\n\n What We Can Learn :\n\n️ Culture is king—it sets the tone for everything.\n️ Empowerment beats micromanagement every time.\n️ Balance and purpose aren’t “extras”—they’re essentials for happy, loyal teams.\n\nAction Time :\nTake a moment to reflect :\n\nAre you creating an environment that inspires, supports, and values your team?\n\nIf not, what small changes can you make today to turn things around?\n Your thoughts?\n\nHave you experienced any of these issues, or have you found solutions that work ? Let’s discuss in the comments—your input might just inspire someone else!\n\n️ Repost this to spread awareness—because happy employees build great companies.\n\n..................................................................\n\nIf you encounter challenges in establishing your Brand Identity, marketing, networking or\ndon't hesitate to get in touch with me for expert guidance and support.\n\n Follow me Haider A. for more tips on workplace happiness and leadership insights !",

As Amitabh Kant emphasized, India must invest in AI research infrastructure to ensure we move beyond adoption to true innovation. (My thoughts on this:\n\n\n\nBeyond large-scale LLMs, India’s strength lies in AI-driven skill mapping, workforce development, and economic planning—areas where structured data and analytics can drive real-world change. At Business Design Lab, we’re exploring this through SkillNet, an AI-powered platform designed to bridge skills and employment with data-driven insights.\n\nTo lead in AI, India must build, not just adopt—starting with strong research, problem-solving, and application-driven innovation.\n\nExciting times ahead!",

This perspective, while true on a surface level, overlooks the deeper, spiritual truth that karma is not just about retribution or reward—it is a vast, intricate dance of energy. It is less about an external power balancing the scales and more about the soul’s evolution through its own choices and consequences.\n\nIn the spiritual context, karma functions as a mirror, reflecting the intentions and energy we project into the universe. Rather than an external force imposing balance, it is the soul itself learning through experience—its own wisdom shaping the circumstances it encounters. Karma can be seen as a tool for refinement, guiding us back to our true nature by helping us understand the interconnectedness of all beings.\n\nRather than viewing karma as a rigid system of balance, it can be seen as an opportunity for conscious awakening, a divine invitation to transcend dualities of good and bad, and instead live in alignment with love, compassion, and the higher truths of existence.",

Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (,)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine () provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",

        "content": "When I I became a Strategic Account Director for the first time, there was only one account I wanted to close: a $45B global airline. It took me 9 months, and we ended up winning a $5.9M deal.\n\nHere’s how I did it, play-by-play ↓\n\n\nBACKSTORY:\n\nI joined a Conversational AI company as a Strategic Account Director focused on CX transformation with Fortune 500 brands. On day 1, this was the account I was obsessed with winning above all others because I was a loyal flier and top customer with them.\n\n\nTHE BLUEPRINT:\n\n1. Used the airline for the basis of my onboarding pitch.\n\nDuring my first week of boot camp at my new company, we had to pick a brand to pitch, and I chose them. It went horribly wrong, but the good thing is that it was in front of internal stakeholders.\n\nI learned so much about our product through my mistakes, but I learned even more about the airline through my extensive research.\n\n\n2. Wrote an open letter for the airline executives based on my customer experience.\n\nHere was the winning structure:\n\n• Kept it brief (2-3 min read)\n\n• Stated my case (importance of giving time back to customers, like me, using their visuals)\n\n• Defined a path forward (gave specific ideas they could use)\n\n• Delivered credibility (our brief history and a non-competitive customer example)\n\n• Provided a compelling call-to-action (invite to an exclusive peer event in London)\n\n\n3. Sent an email to 5 execs with a private link to the open letter.\n\nHere was the email:\n\nHello S**********,\n\nAs I write this from the <airline’s lounge>, I was reminded of just how many miles I fly when I received your letter with my annual <club membership> (attached).\n\nI have been a <airline> loyalist for several years and this year is shaping up to be the year I finally hit <highest tier> status!\n\nThe experiences I receive from <airline>; from the friendly greetings at the gate, to the hospitality at the lounges, to the mobile app experience are all top notch!\n\nBut...\n\nLink: Read The Open Letter to VPs\n\nLook forward to connecting!\n\nBrandon\n\n\n4. I also sent physical packages to arrive on the same day as the email.\n\nThe packages included:\n\n• High-quality materials\n• Initial business case using public-facing info\n• Invitation to validate our numbers and connect\n\nA few days after this was done, I received calls from 3 direct reports to the VPs I sent everything to.\n\nThat led to a successful 9-month engagement where we beat several competitors to win their business.\n\n\nBold, prepared, and creative wins.\n\nEspecially in this market!\n\nWant to read the exact open letter I sent?\n\nUnlock it here:\n\n(Bonus inside)\n\n",

Experiment.\nThis simple slogan at T-Works got me thinking deeply. \n\nWe often mistake repetition for progress but doing the same thing 100 times without learning isn’t growth, it’s wasted effort.\n\n Exploring means we should step out of our comfort zones and seek knowledge that truly adds value. Sticking to the familiar won't lead us to new opportunities.\n Experimenting means we should embrace failure as a learning tool, adjusting our approach and trying again. Growth happens when we adapt, not when we repeat.\n Creating means we should innovate and take action, instead of simply reusing old ideas. It’s about bringing new things to life and making a real impact.\n\nThe world rewards those who are curious enough to explore, brave enough to experiment, and bold enough to create.\nSo ask yourself:\n Are you truly learning, or just repeating?\n Are you evolving, or just circling the same path?\nBreak the cycle. Learn. Adapt. Move forward. \n\nWhat’s one thing you changed after realizing repetition wasn’t working? Let’s discuss in the comments!",

Here are some essential email practices:\n\n1.Use a Clear and Concise Subject Line\n\n- Your subject line should summarize the main point of your email. It allows recipients to prioritize their reading. Keep it brief and to the point.\n\n- Example: \"Meeting Rescheduled to Friday, 3 PM\" instead of \"Meeting Update.\"\n\n2. Greet Appropriately\n\n- Always use a proper greeting such as \"Dear [Name],\" or \"Hello [Name],\" depending on your relationship with the recipient. Using a more formal tone for colleagues or clients you don't know well is a safe bet.\n\n\n3. Be Clear and Direct\n\n- Get to the point early in your email. Be concise and avoid unnecessary details or jargon. Busy professionals appreciate emails that are easy to read and action.\n- Use bullet points or numbered lists if you have multiple points or actions to communicate.\n\n4. Use Professional Language\n\n- Maintain professionalism in tone and language. Avoid slang, emojis, or overly casual language unless your workplace culture permits it.\n- Be mindful of your tone to avoid sounding too demanding or informal.\n\n5. Proofread Before Sending\n\n- Always proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Typos can make you look careless or unprofessional.\n- Double-check names and other details to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. Use Proper Formatting\n\n- Avoid sending long, unbroken paragraphs. Break up your text into readable sections.\n- Use short paragraphs, subheadings, and bullet points when appropriate.\n- Stick to a clean, readable font (like Arial or Calibri) and avoid using colors or unusual formatting unless necessary.\n\n7. Be Mindful of the \"Reply All\" Button\n\n- Only use \"Reply All\" when necessary. Consider if everyone on the email needs to see your response. Overuse of \"Reply All\" can clutter inboxes.\n\n8. Respond Promptly\n\n- Aim to respond to work emails within 24 hours, even if it's just to acknowledge receipt and indicate when you'll provide a detailed response.\n\n9. Use Email Signatures\n\n- Include a professional email signature with your full name, job title, company name, and contact information.\n- A simple signature adds professionalism and makes it easy for others to contact you.\n\n10. Respect Recipients' Time\n\n- Keep emails as brief and to the point as possible. People are more likely to read and respond to your email if they don’t have to sift through excessive text.\n- If an email requires a response, make sure to ask for one in a polite and clear manner.\n\n\n️ Followfor more valuable Stuff\n\n Remote Jobs ATS Resume \n\n\n\n️Repost to help others",

And that's when I realised I liked teaching. \n\nBut, why was I teaching my own class?\n\nThe year was 1991.\n\nOur Industrial Management Professor had this unique idea to give out key topics to students and let them conduct the class for 5 minutes or so. He thought the idea was unique but I know he was lazy.\n\nBut this story is not about him. It's about me discovering that I can teach.\n\nI had taught earlier. During my college days I had taught some school students so I did have some interest.\n\nBut teaching your own class is a different level.\n\nMy topic - How to Motivate a General Manager at SAIL.\n\nSAIL is Steel Authority of India. The topic was chosen well. In those days the general belief was that no one really works in public sector. Wrong but belief is belief.\n\nBy this time I knew I had severe confidence issues when speaking in public. I would stutter and stammer. But I also knew that the only way out was to prepare well and get as much practice I could.\n\nMost importantly - I wanted to get better. I knew I had to.\n\nI poured myself in the assignment. Spent hours in the library. Studied multiple chapters on Motivation. Made my notes. Planned my session. All this for 5 mins.\n\nI had material for 5 hrs but the allotted time was 5 mins. but then I was 19 and naive.\n\nI was to go second. First speaker finished his 5 min class in 2 mins.\n\nWe had about 40 students in the class from what I recall. I opened with a question that I still feel shaped how I think ---\n\nBefore we think HOW we should motivate someone, WHY should we need to do so?\n\nAnd this question paved the way for me to build my teaching style. I conduct the class for the remaining 40 mins of the lecture. My fellow students kept encouraging me and later told me - I taught way better than the Prof.\n\nAnd I knew they were right. Even the most uninterested students were actually listening in my class.\n\nI learnt three key lessons that day. Lessons that I hold dear till today -\n\n1. If you prepare well, confidence is a by-product\n\n2. If you like doing something, pouring yourself into it is easy\n\n3. If you want to get better you have to be ready to start at the bottom.\n\nWhat started as a lazy approach to teaching from our Prof., changed my career.\n\nThis was the talk where I knew I was onto something. I knew I had turned the corner from being an under-confident speaker to someone who will try. I understood the value of preparation. And the most important lesson - you don't get better if you don't try.\n\nAnd for these reasons, I remain forever grateful to Prof.\n\nDid any such chance episode change something deep for you? Want to share?\n\n++++\nPhotos - some recent photos of me teaching :)",
