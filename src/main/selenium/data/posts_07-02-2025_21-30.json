The pace of change in industries, driven by technology, economic uncertainty, and shifting expectations, is reshaping what it means to lead effectively. Boards and executives must consider how to support leadership transitions in a way that maintains momentum and ensures long-term success.\n\nWhat do you think is driving this leadership turnover?

When things don’t go smoothly, people assume they’re failing and give up too soon.\n\n Expecting an easy path sets you up for disappointment. Challenges are part of the process, not signs that you’re on the wrong track.\n\n Blind positivity ignores the power of preparation. If you expect obstacles, you won’t be derailed by them.\n\nThere’s a better way:\n\n Be pessimistic in the short term—expect setbacks, challenges, and failures. They’re normal.\n\n Be optimistic in the long term—trust that if you keep showing up, adapting, and learning, success is inevitable.\n\nMost people quit too soon because they expect short-term ease instead of short-term struggle. But the real winners? They stay in the game.\n\n What’s your take—do you agree or disagree? Let’s discuss in the comments.",

        "content": "The overall read on the labor market today is: continued strength. There are many countervailing factors in the data for January, from numerous revision types to wildfires and winter weather. These things make the story the data tells difficult to parse, and it’s best to examine the new release as a snapshot, rather than a comparison to prior months.\n\nThe January unemployment rate is little impacted by the revisions, and remains low. While the data indicates we added fewer jobs last month, we knew the previous figures were likely a little optimistic, so this shouldn’t come as a surprise. And even though it came in lower than expected, it shouldn’t be alarming.\n\nLast summer we received the preliminary benchmark revisions, and there were some misunderstandings about what those changes meant. Now, we have the official revisions in-hand. Estimates like those found in the jobs report are often revised, and there were several revision types happening this month in the labor market data. Benchmarking refers to the process of aligning this frequent (monthly) data with more comprehensive but less frequent data. The end result is more accurate estimates. Revisions like this are not corrections, but improvements, and their usage is not new. If anything, they represent a strict commitment to data quality.",

        "content": "Leadership Tip: The Power of Consistency Over Motivation\n\nWhen it comes to effective leadership, motivation often gets the spotlight. While motivation can spark action, it’s consistency that sustains progress and drives long-term success.\n\nMotivation is fleeting—it comes and goes, influenced by emotions, circumstances, and external factors. Consistency, however, is a habit, a disciplined commitment to show up, put in the effort, and lead with purpose, even on the days when motivation is nowhere to be found.\nGreat leaders aren't always the most inspired; they're the most consistent. They set clear expectations, follow through on commitments, and model steady, reliable behaviors that their teams can count on. This consistency fosters trust, builds credibility, and creates a culture where excellence is the norm.\n\nIf you find yourself waiting for motivation to strike, shift your focus. Create routines, establish non-negotiable habits, and lead by example. Consistency compounds over time, transforming small daily actions into extraordinary results.\n\nRemember: Motivation gets you started. Consistency keeps you going.",

        "content": "The CEO’s Biggest Enemy: Distraction\n\nIf you’re leading a business—especially in a turnaround—you will be pulled in a hundred different directions. The noise, the fires, the urgent-but-not-important tasks will fight for your attention. And if you’re not ruthless in staying focused on what truly moves the business forward, you’ll pay for it.\n\nI know this firsthand. I let distractions take my focus off the key levers of growth. In January, I missed our revenue forecast. Not how I wanted to start the year. But here’s the reality:\n\n A miss is a symptom. The real problem is what caused it.\nAt the end of the day, as a leader, you cannot afford to miss on three core pillars:\n\n OPEX – Running the Business: Cash flow, operational efficiency, and ensuring the team has the resources they need. This is about keeping the engine running without excess drag.\n New Revenue Growth: No business survives without consistent, scalable growth. When distractions pull you away from the real drivers of revenue—pipeline, sales execution, and partnerships—you feel it.\n Churn & Retention: New revenue means nothing if you can’t keep the customers you fought to win. The best companies aren’t just great at selling, they’re relentless in keeping and expanding customers.\n\n So here’s my hard-earned lesson: Distraction is the most expensive mistake a leader can make. It doesn’t hit you immediately, but when it does, the cost is undeniable.\n\nA CEO/founder once told me something I’ll never forget:\n\n“At the end of it, there’s an invoice due. And you are not going to want to pay it.”\n\nThat invoice? It’s the cost of allowing distraction to creep into your world. And when the bill comes, it’s painful.\n\nFebruary is about ruthless focus. No wasted time, no side quests, no unnecessary noise. Every hour, every decision, every meeting needs to serve one of these three pillars.\n\nIf you’re leading a team, a department, or a company—where are distractions pulling you away from what actually moves the needle?",

It's alarming how quickly they can fool us, and it's crucial that we stay vigilant and aware.\n\nCheck out this video to see how they do it and learn how you can protect yourself. Remember, awareness is our first line of defense against these scams!\n\nKey Tips to Keep Your Money Safe:\n1. Never share your OTP: No legitimate company or person will ever ask for it.\n2. Use secure and complex passwords: Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays.\n3. Enable two-factor authentication: It adds an extra layer of security.\n4. Be cautious of suspicious messages: Verify the source before taking any action.\n\nLet's spread the word and protect ourselves and our loved ones from these threats. Share this post to raise awareness—together, we can make a difference! ",

I graduated prior to Dean Behnam's appointment, this was the first time I had the opportunity to meet him in person, and it was an inspiring encounter\n\nHaving heard so much about his impactful work, it was exciting to finally connect with the visionary behind such transformative initiatives. Dean Behnam’s contributions include transforming the Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University in Boston into an institution with a global focus on experiential learning, as well as leading diversity and inclusion efforts. Under his leadership, the school not only saw increased enrollment but also forged meaningful international partnerships.\n\nReflecting on my own time at Loyola, I can confidently say that pursuing my MBA there was one of the most valuable experiences of my life. It was an inclusive and inspiring journey, especially as an immigrant, that laid a strong foundation for both my personal and professional growth. I deeply value the education I received and am excited to continue contributing to Loyola's growth and its mission of shaping future leaders beyond themselves.\n\nWe also had an insightful conversation about the benefits of experiential learning, and I was thrilled to learn more about—a unique two-year program at Loyola that provides affordable and accessible education to underserved students, particularly first-generation college students and those from low-income backgrounds.\n\nArrupe College’s mission is to offer a rigorous, Jesuit-inspired liberal arts education, creating a pathway for students to earn an associate's degree and either transfer to a four-year institution or enter the workforce. The program's affordability, strong community support, and commitment to social justice make it a remarkable initiative.\n\nThe picture captures a memorable sunset meeting with Deanand. As an alum, I’m excited to contribute to Loyola’s continued growth, especially in supporting initiatives like Arrupe College that empower the next generation of leaders.\n\n\n\nWant more insights on\nand\n?\n Subscribe to the\nhereor\nhere.",

You need something worth selling\n\nNothing else matters if people can’t see a clear path to 5x ROI from your offer.\n\nStart by building a service people actually want.\n\n2. Your profile must reflect your expertise\n\nYour LinkedIn profile isn’t just a resume—\n\nIt’s a credibility multiplier that needs to convert attention into real opportunities.\n\n3. Content creates brand awareness\n\nEvery post should establish you as an authority in your space.\n\nSkip the engagement bait and focus on expertise-driven content.\n\n4. Outreach requires strategy\n\nWith only up to 300-400 monthly connection requests available, each one must count.\n\nThis goes without saying, but don’t use automations—they’re not only ineffective, but can get your account in trouble.\n\nSend manual connection requests to folks with lots of connections in common via LinkedIn’s recommendations.\n\nPro tip: if you go to someone’s profile you’d like to connect with, LinkedIn will also recommend similar accounts.\n\n5. Value outweighs sales gimmicks\n\nYou don’t need elaborate rapport-building schemes when you have real and immediate value to offer.\n\nMature business owners recognize an opportunity when it’s there.\n\nPut these elements together correctly…\n\n…and the results can (and will) be transformative.\n\nThis process has helped my clients add $25,000/month (and beyond) to their pipeline, no matter where they started.\n\nRead the full guide here:",

You transition with a qualifying question.\n→ “As the (title), do you care about (pain point)?”\n→  Or...“Do you already work through (challenge)?\"\n→  \"Like (competitor 1] or (competitor 2) does?”\n\n3. You \"poke the pain\" before pitching to them.\n→  Ask a question that makes them feel it deeply.\n→  Name issue → describe pain → define the cost.\n\n4. You create curiosity, not resistance from them.\n→ “Have you considered [solution] for [benefit]?”\n→  Use an analogy: “It’s like a fire alarm for...”\n\n5. Close with a simple, no-pressure ask of them.\n→ “Would it be crazy for us to find 30 mins?”\n→  Offer two-time slots to make it easier.\n\nThis is how you book more meetings.\n\n+ How you drive more revenue in 2025.\n\nGrab my step-by-step script here:\n\n\n\nPS: What’s been your most memorable call?",

That’s what it feels like trying to change someone who doesn’t want to change.\n\nYou explain. You motivate. You even give them a roadmap. But nothing moves. Because the truth is—change isn’t about effort, logic, or even the best advice. It’s about readiness.\n\nAnd if they aren’t ready, you’re just wasting energy.\n\n So, instead of draining yourself trying to convince the wrong people, shift your focus.

        "content": "Scrum team health checks are often a tickbox exercise with teams being asked to rate elements like events with the result not really helping teams to improve their lot.\nBut if the questions are chosen carefully and the score system promotes improvement then a nice visual 'team DNA' can be created. The questions are divided up into three basic production columns; ideation, creation, validation. These questions are answered using definitions that help to identify where coaching may be needed. The answers are colour coded and hence can be represented in a DNA style strip again which can direct teams and coaches to the areas where enhancements can be made.\nAlthough the questions I have used do not formally contain the Scrum values or theory they tend to be implicit in the questions.\nThe question answers also have a numerical score but this does not tell us as much as the visualisation. Two teams can have the same score but have problems in different areas.\nFeel free to try this with your teams, or amend the questions accordingly for your own agile ecosphere !\n\nIf you think this might be useful to your teams then you can copy the miro board (annotated with instructions) here:",

Challenges often appear insurmountable, but with perseverance and strategic action, they can be overcome. Just as Savitri demonstrated, persistence and purpose-driven action often lead to unexpected breakthroughs.\n\nPresently, I channel determination into refining long-term goals and staying committed despite setbacks.

Here it is.\n\n\nStory time.\n\nA few days ago, I saw that a CEO made a post about how cold calls almost always suck because of the long bridge to connect and annoying beep that many auto dialers have.\n\nI took this as my opportunity to cold call him with a good ol fashion cell phone.\n\nTo my surprise, he answered right away.\n\nAfter asking a few questions, I teased our solution and piqued his interest. I then directed him to’s website where I showed him what it would look like to live VIDEO call prospects on his website (the exact solution I was selling on the phone).\n\nHe liked the idea and booked some time to chat the very next week.\n\nThen, a few days later, I received the comment below on one of my posts.\n\nMoral of the story is this: If you’re an SDR - you NEED to be doing 3 things.\n\n1. Cold calling (Duh).\n2. Prospecting from your linkedin feed.\n3. Posting and building your own personal brand.\n\nSharing content regularly is the ULTIMATE way to build trust.\n\nWhen people trust you more, watch your meeting show rates SKYROCKET.\n\nIt’s that simple folks.\n\n,,,,,,,,,\nDid you notice your meeting show rate increase when you started becoming more active on Linkedin?",

        "content": "BIOMIMICRY CONTINUUM – Part 4 – Update Agent LEARNING\n Fundamental evidence of learning is the ability to recall and utilize what is learned. Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (all links in my comment below)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3 of this series.\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",

Advice coming from people, most of whom have never had to own the consequences of their decisions when it comes to AI. That makes you and your organization a lab rat. They couldn't invent a new algorithm to save their life, they can't honestly tell you much more than ChatGPT could, yet you're paying them. They give a PowerPoint, regurgitate a report, they give advice with no consequence to them, but your AI project that has an 80%+ chance of failing, they aren't really on the hook for it. They aren't having to fire their team, they will just get their $200M/yr paycheck for more 'peanut butter' AI presentations. I've heard stories in both Saudi and the UAE with both countries spending over $1B for these advisory consultants.\n\nI've talked with some of the AI leaders at some of these bigger companies who are in charge of the AI strategy and it reminds me of kids in school who were over their skis on a project. Under qualified, procrastinating and scrambling to get a passing grade. \"Where do YOU think AI will be in 3 years?\"\n\nGuess what I haven't heard?\nAny of them that can justify the cost.",

I think AI will follow the same historical path as data reporting and analytics. Understanding data at the deepest level is a very different skill set than what is taught at top-tier MBA programs. AI is data-driven, and data management, data quality, and costs are inherent pieces of the value equation. There is a huge knowledge gap between the MBA-educated consultants and the data analytics super-stars who have feet-on-the-street. You cannot be an AI expert just by reading an AI article in Fortune Magazine. Unfortunately, purchasing departments and executives with sign-off approvals face a difficult task -- bringing the right data analytics and AI companies in to implement change. Executives will feel pressure to implement AI. Tech companies with brand recognition will only sell their wares. The companies with broad technology experience and an independent perspective on how to implement AI effectively and provide value don't have Fortune 100 brand credentials or Big-5 status. In the next 3 years a lot of money will be spent on AI, although I'm not sure the value-equation will pan-out often enough.",

But what’s shocking is how many people still don’t realize just how big this is.\n\nThis week alone, I have two meetings with companies expanding into the UK, and guess what? They’re hiring far fewer people than they normally would—because AI is doing so much of the work.\n\nAnd yet, so many people still see AI as just a fun tool to generate generic content with ChatGPT. That mindset is dangerous.\n\n AI isn’t just about writing—it’s reshaping entire industries.\nIf you’re not paying attention to this shift, you’re already behind. Don’t wait until it’s too late.",

        "content": "3 harsh truths about RFPs:\n\n1. If you didn't help write it, you're probably not going to win it\n\nMost RFPs are won before they've even been released, due to vendors already influencing & shaping the RFP to their ideal requirements.\n\nThis is done through long-term & in-depth relationships, knowing why and when the customer is going to market.\n\nMost customers don't really care for the RFP process - its usually an adminisrative headache that's a requirement over a certain $$$ investment.\n\nGet ahead of the game by being part of your customers trusted network, knowing their strategic plans, lifecycles & planning solutions accoringly.\n\n2. Most of it isn't going to get read anyways\n\nMany RFP responses are generic marketing guff of 'best in class' & 'industry expertise' that customers eyes glaze over.\n\nTo get past the first round of responses you need to nail the executive summary, the compliance checklist & high-level investment summary.\n\nThen when you're shortlisted you can refine responses and get into the real pre-sales process e.g. scoping the solution properly, business value & commercials.\n\n3. You'll probably lose on price\n\nEven if the criteria scorecard only says '20% scoring on price' you'll lose 80% of RFPs on price.\n\nThis is especially true in the public sector such as government departments or healthcare who basically mandate the cheapest option.\n\nMost RFP responses are shaped to have very low margins on any hardware with margins made on professional services.\n\nThe real money is made in the back-end after you've won through \"scope changes\" or just accepting the deal as a loss-leader to get into the customer long-term.\n\nKeep a firm eye on your proposal value and ensure its in a very competitive range to get past the first gatekeepers.\n\n~~~\n\nStruggling with Tech Sales as a non-Technical AE?\n\nI've put the complete sales process that made a 2 x Top 1% AE without a tech degree in the free Tech Sales Mentorship here:",

        "content": "Years ago, I met a man who had everything—wealth, connections, power. \nBut he lost it all in an instant. Not because of bad luck, not because of the economy, but because he broke trust. \n\nOne moment of dishonesty, one shortcut taken, one value compromised—and the empire he had spent years building collapsed like a house of cards.\n\nTrust isn’t built overnight. It’s earned in drops, but lost in buckets.\n\nEvery single action you take is either making a deposit into your reputation or making a withdrawal. And if you’re not conscious of that, you’ll wake up one day wondering why people don’t believe in you, why opportunities slip away, and why success seems just out of reach.\n\nHere's my take on the above scenario\n\n1. Standards, Not Feelings, Dictate Your Reputation\nYour reputation isn’t built on what you intend to do. It’s built on what you actually do—again and again and again. The little things count.\n\nEvery meeting you show up to on time, every promise you keep, every person you go out of your way to help. These small acts define you.\n\n\"Raise your standards, not just your expectations.\" If you want a reputation of excellence, live like it’s your non-negotiable standard. Treat your word like a contract. Deliver before the reminder. Show up when no one is watching.\n\n\n2. Integrity is What You Do When No One’s Watching\nReputation doesn’t live in LinkedIn recommendations. It lives in the stories people tell when you’re not in the room. The world will talk about you—give them something worth saying.\n\n\"Trust isn’t about perfection, it’s about consistency.\" If you make a mistake, own it immediately. If you promise something, deliver it. And do it not because someone is keeping score, but because integrity is who you are.\n\n\n3. What You Tolerate, You Teach\nEver noticed how people start treating you based on what you allow? If you tolerate excuses from yourself, people will expect less from you. If you cut corners, they’ll assume that’s your standard. But when you demand more from yourself, the world rises to meet you.\n\nDecide today: Are you someone people trust? Or someone they question?\nProtect your reputation like your future depends on it—because it does.\n\n4. Be The Person Who Sets the Standard\nThe world is filled with excuses, with broken promises, with people who overpromise and underdeliver. Don’t be one of them. Be the person whose name carries weight. The person others count on. The one who follows through no matter what.\n\nBecause your reputation travels faster than you do. Make sure it carries your excellence—not your excuses.\n\nNow, go out there and make every drop count!",

What if you miss out on something better?\n\nBut here’s the thing: life isn’t about picking the “perfect” fig. It’s about choosing one, savoring it, and making the most of it—even if you sometimes wonder about the others.\n\nSo, what fig are you reaching for? And how do you deal with the fear of missing out?",
