Forge your own path\n\n> Ignore conventions and industry \"rules\".\n- Forge new paths aligned with your vision.\n- Create product categories that never existed.\n\n3.  Never Stop Reinventing Yourself\n\n> Keep evolving. No coasting on past wins.\n- Disrupt your own products first.\n- Initiate change yourself. Don't wait.\n\n4. Pour Your Heart Into It\n\n> Money is a side effect, not the goal.\n- Create kick-ass products with passion.\n- Prioritise quality over short-term gains.\n\n5. Embrace the Crazy Ones\n\n> Surround yourself with creative risk-takers.\n- Encourage crazy ideas and bold thinking.\n- Create an environment for radical ideas to thrive.\n\n6.

      "content": "India Needs an Airline Brand Ô∏è\n\nI was reading about the Indian aviation industry recently, and one thought struck me: India has airlines, but we don‚Äôt really have a true airline brand.\n\nIndiGo? It‚Äôs convenient, reliable‚Äîbut does it stand for anything more?\nVistara? It had potential but wasn‚Äôt given enough time to build a legacy.\nAkasa? It‚Äôs too new to shoulder that responsibility.\n\nBut then there‚Äôs Air India. With the Tata Group behind it, Air India is sitting on a golden opportunity. Yet, the question is: will they grab it?\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîIndian aviation has been stuck in a loop. Every airline fights to win that one moment when travelers compare ticket prices on apps. Marketing is focused on discounts, flash sales, and price-first decisions.  But brands aren‚Äôt built on discounts.\n\nLook at Emirates. They don‚Äôt sell cheaper tickets‚Äîthey sell an experience. You know you‚Äôre paying more, but you‚Äôre okay with it because of what the brand represents. That‚Äôs the kind of space Air India could occupy for Indian travelers.\n\nThink about it:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ The Tata Factor: The Tatas have the financial strength to play the long game. They‚Äôve already mastered Indian hospitality with Taj Hotels. (Imagine bringing that level of service to the skies.)\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Evolving Travelers: We‚Äôve changed as consumers. People are willing to pay more for a better experience. It‚Äôs not just about reaching the destination anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs about how you get there.\n\nIt‚Äôs about creating a story that connects with people‚Äîone that makes them feel proud to choose Air India. It‚Äôs about more than transportation; it‚Äôs about aspiration.\n\nIf Air India can crack this, it won‚Äôt just be an airline‚Äîit‚Äôll be the Indian airline. The one we look at and say, ‚ÄúYes, that represents us.‚Äù\n\nI really hope the Tatas see this moment for what it is‚Äîa chance to create something iconic.\n\nCan Air India finally become the airline we‚Äôre proud of?
