As leaders, we have to put out the message that we embrace, and not just tolerate, diversity.\"\n\nLike many others, I will watch this space with trepidation.\n\nIn the meantime,will continue to champion change, raise awareness and keep building an inclusive culture.\n\n\n\n[ Image is taken from an article in The Guardian from 10 January.

Instead of just celebrating flashy party and grand get-together we donated to a needy people.\n\nIt‚Äôs incredible how acts of kindness not only bring smiles to others but also positively impact our own well-being. Did you know that helping others releases ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù hormones like:\n Oxytocin ‚Äì the bonding hormone\n Dopamine ‚Äì the happiness booster\n Serotonin ‚Äì the mood regulator\n Endorphins ‚Äì the natural stress relievers\n\nThrough this small act of generosity, we honored my father‚Äôs values and felt a profound sense of connection, joy, and purpose.\n\nHere‚Äôs to celebrating life, spreading kindness, and making the world a better place, one good deed at a time.",
