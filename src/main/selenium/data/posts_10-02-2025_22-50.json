        "content": "Ok, I typically know better than to wade into politics. Hopefully this post isn't seen in that vein.\n\nSaw the headline on this article whereandwarn of the impact of NIH cuts to indirect costs for research institutions.\n\nOne thing I was taught in economics is the fungibility of funds. This effectively means that, despite separation of budgets, money an organization gets for one purpose ultimately allows that organization to perform other unrelated purposes. If you give an institution money for one purpose, say $700M, it allows that organization to spend that much money elsewhere. It doesn't always hold to exact numbers, of course.\n\nIn this instance, while it is true that if the NIH chooses not to offset $700M of Harvard's costs, Harvard may very well make significant cuts in those research programs. Or...\n\nThere could be a recognition that part of the reason that Harvard has the $53,000,000,000 - that's right, $53 Billion with a B - endowment is because it has a phenomenal reputation as a research institution.\n\nI certainly won't make friends at many schools by suggesting this, but for America to pay for soft costs of your academic research while your endowment amasses staggering wealth deserves to be evaluated. It is right for people to question it.\n\nI'm bracing for the pushback here...",

Nearing Burnout:\n\n“I want to contribute, but my workload is at capacity. Can we revisit this later?”\n\nThis shows commitment while protecting your performance and well-being.\n\n2. Plate Is Full:\n\n“I’m at max capacity right now. Which task should take priority to meet expectations?”\n\nYou’re not rejecting work—you’re asking for guidance, proving you’re solution-focused.\n\n3. Need Backup:\n\n“To meet the standard we need, I’ll need extra help. Can we bring in support?”\n\nFrames help as necessary for quality, making it easier for your manager to approve.\n\n4. Feeling Overloaded:\n\n“I’m concerned adding more will hurt my other projects. Can we shift the deadline?”\n\nFocuses on maintaining high standards, not just checking off tasks.\n\n5. Other Deadlines:\n\n“I’m wrapping up another priority now. Once that’s done, I can give this my focus.”\n\nReassures your boss the task will get done—without overloading yourself.\n\n6. Work-Life Balance:\n\n“I have a personal commitment tonight. Can I start this first thing tomorrow morning?”\n\nMaintains boundaries while showing reliability and professionalism.\n\n7. Need More Clarity:\n\n“I want to stay aligned with expectations. Can you clarify which task takes priority?”\n\nEnsures you’re working on what actually matters.\n\n8. Smarter Approach:\n\n“What if we tried [alternative solution] to get the same result more effectively?”\n\nPositions you as a problem-solver, not just someone avoiding extra work.\n\n9. Outside Your Role:\n\n“This isn’t part of my scope, but I’m happy to assist where my skills fit best.”\n\nSets clear boundaries while still being helpful.\n\nSaying “yes” to everything leads to burnout. Saying “no” the right way builds respect.\n\nWhich one do you need to use ASAP?\n\nP.S.\n\nI have a newsletter where I help 100,000+ people learn AI and monetize their skills.\n\nSubscribe here for free:\n\nYou'll get 4 of our best courses for free when you subscribe.\n\nFollow me atfor more posts like this.\n\nAnd repost this to help others get their time back!\n\nThanks for checking this post and stay tuned for more.",

Stay consistent.\n\nYou'll have days where you crush it.\nYou'll have days where you don’t even want to show up.\nYou'll have days where every excuse tells you to stay home.\n\nGo anyway.\n\nBecause every rep, every set, every step forward…\nYou’re proving to yourself that you can do hard things.\n\nYou’re building discipline.\nYou’re sharpening your mindset.\nYou’re creating the future version of yourself that you’ll be proud of.\n\nAnd one day?\nYou’ll be the one inspiring the newcomer.\n\nJust don't forget the Aeropostale t-shirt, the sweatband, and the phone belt clip! Nothing screams \"approachable\" like these accessories. \n\nIf you’re feeling stuck… if you don’t know where to start… if you want a plan that will help you optimize your workouts, look, feel, and perform at your absolute best - I’d love to help.\n\n Go toand click “Get Started.”\n\nJoin our growing SickFitness community of over 30,000 people who are leveling up their fitness, their mindset, and their lives.\n\nLet's get after it this week guys!

The most successful businesses don’t waste time arguing—they align, take action, and become the missing link.\n Marketing isn’t just about awareness—it’s about delivering value that sales can convert.\n Sales isn’t just about closing deals—it’s about building relationships and trust, just like marketing.\n Business development thrives when both work in sync, rather than pointing fingers at what’s \"missing.\"\nInstead of debating where the gap is, let’s focus on bridging it.\nHow does your business ensure seamless collaboration between marketing and sales?

This shift follows Dropbox’s recent move and is driven by changes in shareholder power and legal recommendations favoring Nevada and Texas.\n\nWhy Nevada?\n- Business-friendly regulations\n- Lower legal risks\n- A booming tech & innovation hub\n\nNevada is rapidly becoming a tech powerhouse, attracting industry giants like Tesla, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. From Tesla’s Gigafactory to expanding data centers and fulfilment hubs, Nevada is proving to be much more than just a desert—it’s a prime destination for business and innovation.\n\nWhat do you think about this shift?",

Well, me and my friend took on this challenge and built this simple yet effective Optical data transfer project using ESP8266 (NodeMCU) modules, a laser, and a photodiode.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWe convert a string message into binary and transmit it using the laser. The key idea is that each LASER blink represents 1 while its off-state represents 0. Using this technique, we send the entire binary message through light. The photodiode detects these signals, sends them to the receiving ESP8266, and reconstructs the original message.\n\nCheck out the full demonstration in my YouTube video: \n\n\nHuge thanks tofor being my co-creator on this project! This was truly a team effort!",

Progress isn’t about creating something entirely new; it’s about improving what’s already been done.\n\n𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗽𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:\n\n Proven success: Build on ideas that have already worked.\n\n Faster learning: Learn from others' wins and mistakes.\n\n Incremental improvement: Tweak what’s already there to make it better.\n\n Authenticity: Solve real problems by adapting solutions that already exist.\n\n Expanded creativity: Combine existing ideas in new ways to spark innovation.\n\nGood copying isn’t plagiarism-it’s responsible adaptation with your unique twist.

Selling isn’t about posting once and hoping for results—it’s about showing up, engaging, and staying top of mind.\nThe key takeaway? Repetition isn’t redundancy—it’s reinforcement. There’s always a new way to share the same message, whether through stories, insights, or expertise.\nThe 277% stat is a powerful closer—making it clear that LinkedIn is not just another platform but a high-impact business tool.",

Our fear of failure and doubting our abilities is holding us back.\n\nHow many times have you talked yourself out of pursuing something because you doubted your abilities? Maybe it was applying for that dream job, starting a side hustle, or sharing your ideas with the world.\n\nHere’s the truth: Failure is a teacher. It’s a stepping stone to growth, resilience, and success. But doubt? Doubt is a dream killer. It’s the voice in your head that says, “You’re not good enough,” “What if you fail?” or “It’s not the right time.”\n\nThe reality is, you’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try. Every successful person you admire has faced failure—but they didn’t let doubt stop them.\n\n Here’s how to silence doubt and chase your dreams:\n1️⃣ Acknowledge It: Recognize when doubt is holding you back.\n2️⃣ Reframe Your Mindset: Replace “What if I fail?” with “What if I succeed?”\n3️⃣ Take Small Steps: Progress builds confidence. Start with one actionable step today.\n4️⃣ Surround Yourself with Support: Find people who believe in you, even when you don’t.\n\nRemember, failure is temporary, but regret lasts forever. Don’t let doubt rob you of the chance to achieve something extraordinary.\n\n What’s one dream you’ve been doubting? Let’s encourage each other in the comments. \n\nRepost ️ if you find it useful.

No one ever said, “Wow, that jargon really spoke to me.”\n Add a little playfulness. A well-timed joke opens more doors than a perfectly polished pitch.\n Use humour as a leadership tool. A tense room is full of silence. A relaxed room is full of ideas.\n\nLaughter isn’t just about being funny - it’s about being human.\n\nBut does humour belong in leadership?\n- Some say it builds trust and influence.\n- Others believe it risks credibility.\n\nWhat’s your take - does laughter make leaders stronger or less serious?",

        "content": "Picture this: 3 AM. I'm at the kitchen counter, staring at a page of meticulously researched solutions to my mom’s challenges. I know these ideas could help. I know they’d work.\n\nAnd in just a few hours, I'll sit across from her, share everything I’ve prepared…and she’ll shut down every single one.\n\nThat's when it hit me – being right isn't enough. In fact, sometimes, it's actually the problem.\n\nBecause let's be real: None of us likes being told what to do, even when we desperately need the advice. (Myself included. Especially myself.)\n\nSo then, what does work? How do we help people not just see their challenges, but own them — and discover solutions they'll actually embrace?\n\nTurns out, my father had been telling me the answer all along, I just didn’t really get it:\n\nStop solving. Start asking.\n\nInstead of offering solutions, try:\n- \"What do you think is getting in the way?\"\n- \"How would you like things to be different?\"\n- \"What's worked for you in the past?\"\n\nThe real magic unfolds when you:\n- Get genuinely curious about their world\n- Share observations without judgment (\"I notice you get excited when...\")\n- Create space for them to connect their own dots\n\nThat morning, I sat with my mom at her kitchen table. As I fought every urge to pull out my carefully crafted solutions, I asked instead, \"What would make things easier for you?\"\n\nShe paused, stirred her coffee, and started talking. Not defending. Not resisting. Just...sharing. And in that moment, I saw what my father had been trying to teach me for years.\n\nThe hardest part wasn't letting go of my solutions. It was realizing that watching someone find their own way is both terrifying and beautiful.\n\nBut when my mother came up with her own plan that morning, her eyes had a spark I hadn't seen in years.\n\nSometimes the best way to help isn't by being right. It's by being quiet long enough to let someone else find their way.\n\nWhat's your go-to question when someone -- an employee, spouse, child or colleague -- comes to you with a problem?",

Here’s how: ⬇️\n\n1. When you're underpaid\n↳ Waiting for recognition won’t get you a raise.\n↳ Track your impact and tie it to business results.\n↳ Negotiate from strength, not need.\n\n2. When office politics drain you\n↳ Influence beats involvement in drama.\n↳ Build key relationships before you need them.\n↳ Keep the focus on your results, not the noise.\n\n3. When your boss is difficult\n↳ Align with their language - mirror key phrases they value.\n↳ Acknowledge their concerns before responding.\n↳ Stay neutral, not emotional.\n\n4. When workload overwhelms\n↳ Don’t just work harder - realign priorities.\n↳ Break tasks into 25-minute sprints to regain control.\n↳ Master the strategic ‘no’.\n\n5. When growth feels blocked\n↳ No one will hand you a roadmap - create your own.\n↳ Seek mentors outside your direct circle.\n↳ Treat every project as a learning opportunity.\n\n6. When feedback is vague\n↳ Guessing leads to frustration - ask for specifics.\n↳ “Can you share an example of what good looks like?”\n↳ Align expectations early to avoid confusion.\n\n7. When coworkers test your patience\n↳ Set boundaries, not battles.\n↳ Address actions, not personalities.\n↳ Their behavior reflects on them - not you.\n\n8. When meetings waste your time\n↳ Long calls don’t mean productivity.\n↳ Propose focused 25-minute alternatives.\n↳ Ask: “Could this be an email?”\n\n9. When others take credit for your work\n↳ Your silence lets it happen.\n↳ “I appreciate the mention - here’s how I developed this.”\n↳ Keep records and involve key decision-makers early.\n\n10. When culture turns toxic\n↳ Align with influence, not dysfunction.\n↳ Observe who really drives decisions and build alliances.\n↳ Exit strategically - on your terms.\n\n11. When reorgs disrupt your career path\n↳ Adaptability is your strongest skill.\n↳ Build cross-functional relationships now - not later.\n↳ Stay sharp, stay prepared, stay ready.\n\nYour career won’t be shaped by the easy moments.\nIt’ll be defined by how you handle the hardest ones.\nMaster those, and you’ll master your trajectory.\n\nWhat’s one career challenge you turned into an advantage?\nShare with us in the comments.\n\n️ Share these and support your network\n Followfor leadership career tips",

It's about genuine connection.\n\nEvery interaction is an opportunity to understand deeper customer needs.\n\nEvery feedback is a potential breakthrough.\n\nSuccessful companies don't just sell products. They solve meaningful problems.\n\nThey create ecosystems of value, not just transactional relationships.\n\nThe most powerful value addition happens when you see beyond the immediate transaction. \n\nWhen you genuinely care about transforming customer experiences.\n\nRemember: Value isn't what you think you're offering.

Workout routines, journaling, meditation, meal prep, productivity hacks.\n\nIt’s overwhelming, and when you miss a day, it’s game over.\n\nInstead: Shrink it. Start with a habit so small it’s impossible to fail.\n\nThink: Write 1 sentence, not a full journal entry. Just go to the gym to get a quick pump, not a full workout.\n\nSmall wins build momentum.\n\n2️⃣ You Copy Someone Else’s Routine:\n\nYou read about someone’s 5am cold showers, 10 step morning routine, and perfect productivity system, and think, “I’ll do that!”\n\nBut it’s their life, not yours.\n\nHabits stick when they fit into your day. Instead of forcing change, anchor new habits to things you already do\n\nAfter brushing your teeth, do 10 pushups.\n\nAfter making your coffee, open up your Bible.\n\nThis approach works because you’re building on your life, not trying to rebuild it.\n\n3️⃣ You Rely on Motivation:\n\nMotivation is fleeting.\n\nNetflix, TikTok, and doom scrolling will win every time if you’re relying on willpower.\n\nWhat works instead?\n\nSystems.\n\nTiny, anchored, celebrated habits that remove decision fatigue and make consistency automatic.\n\n Here’s the secret:\n\nThe habits you stick with today will shape your future self.\n\nBut you don’t need to be perfect, you just need to start small, stay consistent, and make it yours.\n\n Remember this:\n\nThe work you do today will bear fruit in 90 days. What kind of life are you planting for yourself?\n\n What’s one small habit you’re building this week?\n\nIf you're unsure...\n\nGo check out this week's Meaningful Momentum Newsletter.\n\nI discuss exactly how to get out of habit hopping and into a new routine that takes you from where you are to where you were meant to be.\n\nCheck it out:",

My accountability comes down to reporting my assistant (who's also in charge of organizing my calendar), what are the things I do during the day. I found that focusing on only one habit at a time makes all the difference. A few months ago it was social media. Today is how early I get up. In order to change that, I report her what time I went to sleep and why. I already managed going getting to sleep one hour sooner (and do it on autopilot). This took me more than a month though, but it's well worth it.",

        "content": "How does a PC communicate with a microcontroller that lacks a native USB port?\n\nIt’s all thanks to the USB/UART bridge – a powerful tool in embedded systems.\n\nWhether you’re working on debugging, IoT, or industrial applications, understanding this bridge can simplify hardware integration and boost communication reliability. Here’s a clear breakdown of how USB/UART bridges streamline these connections and some real-world use cases:\n\n Data Flow & Conversion: The bridge handles data flow from USB to UART, transforming complex USB signals into a format compatible with microcontrollers.\n\n Reliable Debugging: By linking to a terminal, the bridge makes it easy to capture live data logs, trace issues, and get real-time insights – essential for identifying bugs quickly.\n\n IoT Communication: For IoT applications, USB/UART bridges enable seamless data exchange between sensors and microcontrollers, especially in prototyping and testing phases.\n\n Industrial Monitoring: In industrial environments, where legacy devices still use UART, these bridges connect them to modern systems, making data collection and monitoring far more efficient.\n\nBridges like FTDI, CP210x, and CH340 have specific strengths, from speed and reliability to cost-effectiveness. Each bridge plays a unique role, so knowing when to use which bridge can be a game-changer.\n\nDive into my latest article on parlezVousTechto explore step-by-step details, common pitfalls, and best practices.",

This B2B startup scaled lean by breaking the first rule of startups:\n\nThey didn't start by building an MVP.\n\nAfter founding two startups, raising multiple rounds, and landing two acquisitions, I've seen firsthand how the game has changed.\n\nYet 15 years after Eric Ries' \"The Lean Startup,\" founders are still running the same playbook:\n\n1. Build MVP\n2. Run countless sales experiments\n3. Scale marketing\n\nBut in 2025, that playbook is burning founders out:\n\n24-36 months to find product-market fit\n$10M-$30M in funding gone\nBloated teams brute-forcing growth\n\nAnd here’s the truth nobody tells you: In a world where AI can build anything overnight, the battle isn’t over features. It’s over attention.\n\nThe new playbook? Flip the script upside down:\nBuild Audience → Test Demand → Ship Product\n\nIt's called Audience-Led Growth (h/t&who pioneered this thinking).\n\nAnd at, we're not just preaching it - we're betting our company on it.\n\nOur goal? $30M ARR with just the 3 founders. The secret isn't JUST human + AI scalability - it's building an audience that's hungry for what we'll create.\n\nThink about it:\n\nWhen AI can build any feature overnight\nWhen every startup has access to the same tools\nWhen products are becoming commodities\n\nThe winners won't be the ones with the best AI. They'll be the ones with the strongest audience.\n\nNeed proof? Let's talk about's RB2B.\n\nBefore writing a single line of code, they cracked something more valuable than product-market fit:\n\nThey cracked exponential audience growth.\n\nThe result? $4M ARR in 12 months with just 6 people.\n\nHow?\n\nThey flipped the traditional playbook:\n\n1. Built massive reach in their target market\n2. Tested offerings with their engaged audience\n3. Developed only what already had proven demand\n\nThat's Audience-led growth. And it's about to change everything about how we build startups.\n\nThe next wave of billion-dollar companies won’t be the ones with the biggest funding rounds or feature-packed products.\n\nThey’ll be small, elite teams who master AI scalability and Audience-Market Fit.\n\nAnd they won't just compete with giants.\n\nThey'll become them.",

        "content": "Remember when leadership was all about the leader and the leader only?\n\nThe woman making the decisions, always with the answers.\nThe man at the helm, commanding attention and taking control.\nThe person steering the ship, dictating the course and calling all the shots.\n\nThink about the larger than life personas we grew up watching:\n⇢ Gibbs from NCIS—decisive, confident, and always in control (or quick with a head slap)\n⇢ Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada—a commanding and sometimes cruel presence who made sure everyone knew who was boss.\n⇢ House—where to start… addiction or unwavering arrogance.\n\nBack then, leadership was defined by being the loudest and most authoritative voice in the room.\n\nBut today, what employees value in leadership couldn’t be more different.\n\nTake leaders like Ted Lasso or the new Miranda Bailey addressing burnout in young residents. Although sometimes unconventional or even silly, these are the leaders people admire now—leaders who empower their teams, inspire collaboration, and focus on bringing out the best in others.\n\nWhen you look at what employees appreciate most in their leaders—whether through Glassdoor reviews or everyday conversations—it’s not about a larger than life boss or a creative genius.\n\nIt’s about how leaders empower others, create space for collaboration, and bring out the best in their teams.\n\nThis shift didn’t just happen for me professionally—it’s been personal, too.\n\nOne of my greatest strengths is how fast my brain works.\n\nBut I’ve learned that this strength also has a downside: I used to jump to solutions so quickly that I didn’t take the time to fully listen to my team or understand what they truly needed.\n\nSo, I had to shift.\n\nNow, I pause. I take a breath. I leave space for others to finish their thoughts. And I ask clarifying questions like:\n\n“How can I best support you?\n“What do you need right now?\"\n\"Do you need a shoulder, a solution, or a cheerleader?”\n\nThis shift—from jumping to answers to creating space for others—has been transformational.\n\nLeadership isn’t about how I show up; it’s about how I help others show up as their best selves.\n\nThe best leaders don’t seek attention, titles, or the spotlight—they focus on elevating others and creating impact through their team.\n\nHow has your perspective on leadership evolved? Let’s share ideas in the comments. ",

Yes, they may help clear the way, but ultimately it’s up to you to - sometimes a team - to figure it out.\n\nThis is scary to many.

Early on, I focused heavily on strategy, structure, and outcomes—ensuring that processes were followed and goals were met. While those are still important, my leadership style has evolved to prioritize people and relationships above all else.\n\nI’ve come to see leadership as less about directing and more about empowering. Actively listening, fostering trust, and creating space for collaboration have become central to my approach.

Turns out, there was quite an appetite for that service, and I consider myself blessed to have worked closely with teams from Charleston to Dallas to San Francisco. \n\nWhenand I moved from Scottsdale to Kansas City last March, the plan was to continue doing the type of work that I love, and grow at scale. What I hadn't planned on was the fortuitous referral to,, and. These three, and the incredible women & men alongside them, have built a purpose driven org that brings an unrivaled real-world perspective to the leadership development space. \n\nFor years my clients have confided that big corporate consultants are often rigid & greedy, yet solo-practitioners can sometimes be under-resourced. Solutions 21 is an agile, tactical, 30-person org with an astonishing amount of talent for its clients to take advantage of: business owners, United States military combat veterans, ex-college & professional athletes, published authors, PhD thought leaders...and now, a humble Cutco knife salesman turned Ironman triathlete turned father-of-four, etc... \n\nMy excitement for the future is second only to my gratitude for the past. The people, places, and partners who have been part of the journey thus far, well, you're not going anywhere and neither am I. This update only bolsters my bandwidth to continue serving leaders and their teams on their respective missions, only now, I'm bringing some serious reinforcements! ",

        "content": "Why Sales Training Alone Isn’t Enough—Salespeople Must Master Negotiation to Win \n\nI’ve spent years in sales, coaching, and negotiation training, working across industries, from high-stakes corporate sales to complex deal-making. And one thing is crystal clear:\n\n Selling alone doesn’t close deals. Negotiation does.\nEven if you’re a master of consultative selling, there comes a moment where selling stops working—and negotiation must take over.\n\nToo many salespeople step into the business battlefield armed only with selling techniques—pitching, persuading, handling objections—but with no defense, no counterattack, no ability to adjust. Selling alone is like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\n\n The Biggest Sales Challenges—And Why Negotiation is the Answer\n\n1. Getting Ghosted by Prospects\n Selling alone: You chase, follow up, and hope for a response.\n With negotiation: You create urgency and leverage so prospects feel compelled to engage.\n Negotiation skill: Position your offer as a loss if ignored, rather than just another sales pitch.\n\n2. Customers Expect More & Give Less\n Selling alone: You pile on more benefits, hoping to outshine competitors.\n With negotiation: You shift the conversation to value, not price, making customers work for concessions too.\n Negotiation skill: Trade, don’t cave—if they want a lower price, they commit to a longer contract.\n\n3. Intense Market Competition\n Selling alone: You get stuck in price wars.\n With negotiation: You differentiate beyond price—leveraging relationships, exclusivity, and structured deals.\n Negotiation skill: Control the deal structure so competitors can’t easily match your terms.\n\n4. Pricing Objections Kill Deals\n Selling alone: You offer discounts just to close.\n With negotiation: You justify value through ROI, risk reduction, and strategic concessions—without cutting margins.\n Negotiation skill: Shift the conversation from cost to investment.\n\n5. Long Sales Cycles Drain Energy\n Selling alone: You wait, follow up, and hope for a decision.\n With negotiation: You control the timeline with decision triggers and strategic urgency.\n Negotiation skill: Create real deadlines that move deals forward.\n\nKnow When to Stop Selling & Start Negotiating\n\nEven consultative selling has limits. At some point:\nYou’ve pitched. You’ve positioned value. You’ve listened.\nBut if you keep selling when you should be negotiating, you lose control.\n Selling presents value.\n Negotiation shapes the terms of that value.\n Sales gets you in the door. Negotiation gets you the contract.\n\nThe best salespeople aren’t just sellers—they are deal architects.\n\nAre your teams negotiating, or just selling? Because the real winners in today’s market aren’t just the best salespeople…\nThey are the best negotiators.\n\nLearn more about negotiating skills with",

Three things came to mind:\n\n Master the Fundamentals: Just as great players excel at blocking and tackling, great leaders thrive on solid fundamentals—business acumen, industry knowledge, and leadership skills. The secret? Deliberate practice and continuous learning.\n\n Cultivate Agility: The best athletes, like Peyton Manning, adapt in real time. Likewise, agile leaders embrace change, think critically, and anticipate what’s around the corner.\n\n Obsess Over Focus: Winning isn’t about the scoreboard—it’s about consistent execution. Leaders who focus on daily excellence, not just long-term goals, build lasting success.\n\nReady to elevate your leadership game?
