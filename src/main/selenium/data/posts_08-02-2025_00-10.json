It’s about doing the right things.\n\nLet’s break some myths:\n Myth #1: \"Work-Life Balance is the Key to Success\"\n Reality: Prioritization changes everything. Trying to “balance” everything leads to burnout. The real game-changer? Knowing what actually moves the needle.\n\n Myth #2: \"You Just Need More Motivation\"\n Reality: You can’t fix what you don’t diagnose. If you’re feeling stuck, the problem isn’t motivation—it’s clarity. Fix the strategy, and momentum follows.\n\n Myth #3: \"Hard Work Guarantees Results\"\n Reality: Ownership & accountability drive success. Effort without direction is wasted energy. The most successful people don’t just work hard—they work smart and take responsibility.\n\n Myth #4: \"More Meetings = More Progress\"\n Reality: Meetings without clear purpose kill productivity. If you’re constantly in meetings, ask yourself—are you actually getting things done or just talking about them?\n\n Myth #5: \"Delegation Solves Everything\"\n Reality: Delegation without clarity leads to even worse inefficiency. Before you delegate, make sure you understand what’s actually important. Ownership matters.\n\n 𝗕𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲:\n Clarity on priorities changes everything.\n You can’t fix what you don’t diagnose.\n Ownership & accountability drive success.\n\n Want to go deeper on this?

But where’s the fun in that?\nSo, I reached out to 25 CEOs—real people leading real companies through real challenges—and asked them one simple question:\n\n“What does leadership mean to you?\n\nThe answers? \nSome were profound. Some were unexpected. Some made me pause, sip my coffee, and think, “Damn, that’s good.”\n\nA few favorites:\n1️⃣ “Leadership isn’t about being the smartest person in the room—it’s about creating a room where everyone feels smart.”\n2️⃣ “Great leaders don’t have all the answers. They just ask better questions.”\n3️⃣ “It’s not about having power; it’s about how you use it when no one’s watching.”\n\nI've uploaded the first of five I will share this is from Nick Egan, PhD.\n\nWriting this article wasn’t just another assignment—it was a masterclass. A reminder that leadership isn’t about titles, corner offices, or LinkedIn buzzwords. It’s about impact, integrity, and influence.\n\n What’s the best leadership advice you’ve ever received? Drop it in the comments—I’d love to hear your take.",

It could be the way you worked, the people you interacted with, or the schedule it afforded you.\n\nFind what lights you up and keep going in that direction. If you're like me, it might mean going down a new path you create for yourself.\n\nHappy Friday \n\n-\n\nImage: [Isabel happily drinking a watermelon drink]",

The one that hit you emotionally? Still stuck in your head.\n\nThat’s the power of storytelling.\n\nAnd no, it’s not just for books.\n\nStorytelling is what makes people pay attention, on LinkedIn, in your branding, in your business, everywhere.\n\nBecause let’s be real, no one wants to read:\n\n “We are a leading company in XYZ industry.”\n “I am a highly experienced professional with 10+ years of expertise.”\n “Our product has amazing features like A, B, and C.”\n\nYawn.\n\nPeople don’t connect with fancy words and robotic statements. They connect with real, human stories.\n\n A struggle you faced and how you overcame it\n A mistake that taught you a big lesson\n A weird, unexpected moment that changed your thinking\n A client success story that actually feels real\n\nThat’s what makes people stop scrolling. That’s what builds a brand people trust.\n\nSo, how do you develop this skill? Start practicing storytelling EVERYWHERE.\n\nYour LinkedIn posts? Tell a story.\nYour sales pitch? Tell a story.\nYour personal brand? Root it in your story.\n\nBecause the brands that win? They don’t just sell. They tell stories that make people feel something.\n\n\n P.S.

Here’s why quality data is crucial for maximizing AI’s impact in patient care:\n\n1️⃣ Accuracy and Reliability\n→ Reliable data ensures AI models make accurate decisions. In healthcare, precision is everything—faulty data can lead to misdiagnoses and unsafe treatment plans, putting patient safety at risk.\n\n2️⃣ Bias Mitigation\n→ High-quality, diverse datasets reduce bias, ensuring AI algorithms treat all demographics fairly. This helps address health disparities and promotes equitable care.\n\n3️⃣ Improved Patient Outcomes\n→ Quality data enables tailored treatments, enhancing clinical decision support and driving better patient outcomes through personalized care.\n\n4️⃣ Operational Efficiency\n→ Clean, organized data streamlines processes like patient enrollment and reduces administrative tasks, allowing healthcare teams to focus on patient care instead of data management.\n\nThe takeaway? In healthcare, data quality is not a “nice-to-have”—it’s essential for safe, effective AI applications.\n\nReady to unlock AI’s full potential with high-quality data? Let’s talk.",

Humans can't build data centers fast enough and Nvidia will win long-term big time thanks to Jensen. The moment we find efficiency gains we look for the new frontier. This reminds me of repeat advise that rings true: some people are short sighted and resist chasing tech projects because the current cost (e.g. tokens) are prohibitive. With the supply/demand we are facing you are expect the cost per token to continue >30% drops for the foreseeable future. Knowing that, you might give a project a green light that puts you in the red today, but in the green ahead of your competitors when the cost reduction continues on.\n\nYou can't make all your decisions in the \"now\" or you'll miss the \"next\", gotta follow the puck.\n\nIf I had $1M/month to burn on LLM inference I would.\nIf I had $1B/month to burn on LLM inference I would.\nIf I had $1T/month to burn on LLMs...

Now the provide us with two badges.\n\n\nAnd today, when I used this Eco saver badge for delivery, I was amazed to see the order getting delivered under 30 mins. That's how much they have optimised the grouping!\n\n\n----\nIf you are still reading, I assume you found the article an interesting read, let me know your favorite part of it in the comments.\n\nImage source:blogs",

I’ve been freelancing and running micro-projects for years. Yet, my inbox looks like I’m CEO of a Fortune 500 company.\n\nIf I’m drowning in this noise as a solopreneur, I can’t imagine what actual business owners face daily. The sheer volume of unsolicited “solutions” is overwhelming and I’ve learned to sniff out the empty promises. Most of these messages are copy-pasted, irrelevant, or worse… scams dressed as “partnerships.”\n\nBut instead of deleting them all, I did something radical: I replied.\n\nI asked: “Why me?”\n\nThe answers were telling:\n60% ghosted.\n30% sent templated excuses.\n10% actually paused… and apologized.\n\nThis isn’t just about spam-it’s about how we define “expertise” today. When everyone claims to be a guru, no one is.

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

Animesh wrote, “420 likes andgoes public! ”\n\n: BUILT AS A JOKE\n\nAnimesh Chouhan said that he developedas a joke during his free time. But after it received a lot of traction on social media, he is now thinking of taking the project ahead and even seeking investment.\n\nJoking about offering 10% equity in return, Chouhan said he would seek investment in order to get the domain name.\n\nCurrently, the website shows the following text:\n\n“\nDough or Die: The Great Gol Roti Challenge\n\nComing soon…”\n\nNETIZENS REACT\n\nAnimesh Chouhan’s invention received a lot of responses from social media users. While some suggested the need for more tools like, others gave feedback on the tool itself.\n\nOne user wrote, “So Indian developers are busy in making such craps, i see.” Animesh responded by saying that the tool only took him 5 minutes to make.\n\nA second user wrote, “The US has ChatGPT, China has DeepSeek, and we have.”\n\nIn a sarcastic comment directed to OpenAI’s Sam Altman, another user wrote, “sit down sama, India has arrived.”\n\nOne individual also pointed out that the tool measures only a roti’s shape, not its thickness. According to them, the thickness of a roti is also a key factor in determining the taste and texture.\n\nThe tool also received some backlash for being misogynist. One user wrote, “how about programming something that’s not misogynistic or based on a particular gender next time.”\n\nAnimesh countered by writing, “Who said this platform is only for women? If you assumed that, then that's your own misogyny showing, not mine. We have men posting here too. Cheers!”",

The primary enablers of RKE success are:\n·        Biomimicry – imitating what works all around us, all the time, rather than investing in large scale random experimentation.\n·        Real-world Development Lab – the innovative methods have been designed and tested as components of successful enterprise solutions.\n·        Realistic Target – rather than trying to match and exceed human intelligence, of which we have limited knowledge and conflicting theories, RKE enables analytics tools that leverage human expertise together with what we do know about intelligence.\n\nHigh Value Use Case Examples\na.     Complex Decision Processes\n-F50 bank needed to select new technology and vendor for global implementation. The decision process required 50+ SVP & VP participants, with an estimated duration of 18 months.\n-RKE Paradigm methodology and software was used by the project manager to model all the RFP requirements to the responders’ documents, leading to a nearly unanimous decision in 12 weeks.\nb.     Transforming Data into New Knowledge\n-Leading research university and hospital looking to find genetic variants of unknown significance that could be linked to endometriosis and potentially reclassified, but there were only 18 patient samples available.\n-RKE Paradigm methodology and software were used to build a digital twin ecosystem of the problem enabled discovery of previously unseen multidimensional and multiscale relationships. The results were published in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics.\nc.     Modeling Organizations as Complex, Dynamic Systems\n-F50 Pharma was accountable for seven distinct domains of regulations and standards, and seven operational groups monitored changes in requirements and internal compliance.\n-RKE Paradigm methodology and software were used to model the people, processes, technology, and information required as a dynamic ecosystem of organizational competency units, enabling a 70% resource reduction. The executive sponsor won the company’s highest innovation award.\n\nThere is a significant gap between the RKE Paradigm and traditional architectures. The diagram in the image describes how the architectures can collaborate.",

        "content": "Yesterday, I had an insightful chat with a CEO of a high-growth B2B demand generation agency. We debated B2B buying in the age of AI... \n\nWe discussed how buying journeys are evolving in the new world of AI.\n\nWatching the latest insights from OpenAI how Sales agents take over all the mundane tasks SDRs and AEs are executing on a daily basis now.\n\nOne thing becomes clear: Your buyers are done waiting for live sales calls.\n\nThey want answers—on their time.\n\nB2B buying has changed. Yet, most revenue teams still rely on the same outdated playbook:\n\n• Cold outbound. Generic decks. Endless follow-ups.\n• Forcing meetings when buyers would rather self-educate.\n• Ignoring the fact that buyers only spend 5 percent of their journey engaging with vendors.\n\nYour champion? They’re drowning in internal discussions.\nYour decision-makers? They weren’t even in the room.\n\nThe old way of selling is breaking. The best teams today are closing deals asynchronously.\n\n𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗕𝘂𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀\nThey don’t dislike you. They just prefer to engage on their own time.\n\n• They check LinkedIn on their commute.\n• They research at night after their kids are in bed.\n• They debate your proposal in Slack—not on your follow-up call.\n\nIf your entire sales process depends on live meetings, you’re already losing.\n\nInstead, the best revenue teams sell between meetings.\n\n𝟱 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗠𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗔𝗱𝗼𝗽𝘁\n\n1) Ditch Cold Emails—Engage on LinkedIn Instead\n• Most sales emails are ignored. LinkedIn DMs get 3-5x more replies.\n• Connect with buyers before they are in-market.\n• Comment on their posts 3x per week so you’re visible before outreach even starts.\n\n2) Use Video to Reinforce Key Takeaway\n• Buyers forget 80% of what was said in your meeting.\n• A 2-minute video recap keeps your value fresh.\n\n3) Pre-Demo Content = Faster Sales Cycles\n• Buyers hate generic first calls.\n• Instead, send a pre-recorded demo with timestamped highlights.\n• Let buyers self-educate before the meeting, so calls focus on unique pain points.\n\n4) Centralize Information in a Digital Sales Room like\n• Sales decks get buried in email threads.\n• A Digital Sales Room keeps all key content in one place\n• Now your deal stays top-of-mind—even when you’re not in the room.\n\n5) Multi-Thread by Personalizing Follow-Ups\n• Champions struggle to sell internally. Make it easy for them.\n• Instead of one generic follow-up email, send custom messages to each stakeholder.\n• Give your champion everything they need to move the deal forward without needing another meeting.\n\nThe best sales teams aren’t forcing more meetings.\nThey’re embedding themselves in the buyer’s decision-making process—without being intrusive.\n\nWhat is your opinion on the future of B2B buying?\n\n\n--\n️ 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁 to help other Revenue Leaders.\n 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲 to my Newsletter for Weekly Revenue Tips.",

No proper training & enablement on how to engage with buyers in the first place\n2. Most sellers still aren’t advisors, they are brought in to increase revenue but aren’t told that for that they need to find a way to help X amount of buyers per month\n3. Just waiting for buyers to make up their mind in time is a dangerous game, no? I’m all for buyer-centric journeys and this definitely works for the big name that Personio has become…\n\nBUT\n\nIf you wouldn’t have done those cold calls, emails, linkedin messages in the beginning I’m sure this wouldn’t have gone so fast.\n\nIt’s an allbound story and you preferably want to be everyone so your buyers can indeed:\n1. See your stuff on the channel they are available most\n2. Reply on their time when the timing is right\n3. Be nurtured and advised, whether that’s through content or a call\n\nFor one of our customers we converted 500K ARR via email last year. Yes, they have inbound, yes they have content, but the effect of cold email?\nLast minute getting a seat at the table of a vendor selection & winning a deal in 2 days time.",

His journey from witnessing the harsh realities of street life to creating impactful solutions is one you won’t want to miss.\n\nKal's story isn't just about law enforcement; it's about understanding the root causes of crime and creating real, lasting change.\n\nKal shares his experiences in one of North America's most challenging environments, describing the complex socio-economic factors that contribute to the open-air drug market and the cycle of violence. He talks about the \"perfect storm\" of social housing, mental health challenges, and organized crime that plagues the Downtown Eastside. But more importantly, he shares the pivotal moment that shifted his focus from reactive policing to proactive community building.\n\nThis realization led Kal to found the KidsPlay Foundation, a registered charity dedicated to providing youth with positive alternatives. He explains the six streams of KidsPlay's work – education, sports, mentorship, environment, clinical counseling, and community patrol – and shares inspiring stories of kids whose lives have been transformed. From educational field trips to sports programs and mentorship opportunities, KidsPlay offers a lifeline to vulnerable youth, helping them develop valuable skills and make positive choices. Kal's powerful \"mahout\" metaphor perfectly illustrates the importance of instilling positive values early in life.\n\nJoin me, Thomas Scaria, ultra-marathoner and resilience coach, as I talk with Kal about his incredible journey, the challenges facing inner-city youth, and the transformative power of hope and opportunity. This is a conversation that will leave you inspired and motivated to make a difference.\n\nTune in to the Resilience+Rise podcast now! (Full Podcast & connection in the comments)",
