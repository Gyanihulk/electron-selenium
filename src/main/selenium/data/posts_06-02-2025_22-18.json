        "content": "The Power of Taking Initiative: Be the One Who Moves First\n\nIn every workplace, classroom, and even personal journey, there are two types of people: those who wait for things to happen and those who make things happen. The difference is initiative.\n\nTaking initiative means stepping forward before you're asked, solving problems before they escalate, and creating opportunities instead of waiting for them.\nIt’s the quality that separates leaders from followers, innovators from bystanders.\n\n At work, those who take initiative don’t just meet expectations; they exceed them, making themselves indispensable.\n\n In education, students who take initiative don’t just absorb knowledge; they seek it, question it, and apply it.\n\n In personal growth, initiative means choosing action over excuses, and persistence over procrastination.\n\nBut taking initiative isn’t always easy. Fear of failure, uncertainty, and self-doubt can hold us back.\n\nThe truth is, the first step is always the hardest—but also the most rewarding.\n\nSo, what’s one small way you can take initiative today? A conversation you’ve been avoiding? A skill you’ve been meaning to develop? A bold idea waiting to be shared?\n\nThe best time to start was yesterday. The second-best time? Right now. \n\n\n\nFollow",

It’s a reckoning.\n\nFor years, companies have thrown people into management with no training, no support, and no real systems to help them succeed. Now, younger employees are watching their managers struggle and asking:\n\nWhy would I sign up for that?\n\nThis isn’t the end of management. It’s the beginning of fixing it.\n\nHere’s what actually needs to change:\n• Stop promoting people without leadership training. A title isn’t a skill.\n• Give managers real support, not just more responsibility.\n• Ditch outdated processes that bury managers in busywork instead of leadership.\n\nGen Z isn’t rejecting leadership.\nThey’re rejecting burnout, micromanagement, and dysfunction.\n\nAnd honestly? So did Millennials.\n\nFix management, and the next generation will step up.\n\nKeep ignoring it, and they’ll step out.\n\nIs it really a “manager crash”?\nOr just proof the system needs redefining?",

We do have two product demo meetings per week (sometimes cancel one if it's not worth it) and the rest we work asynchronously.

With my growing experience, skills, and the help of smart tools, tasks do get simpler. But, just like at the gym, if you want to keep growing, you have to keep pushing for more. And when you push for more, it stays hard. Sure, lifting a 30 lb dumbbell has become easier, but I’m not staying at that weight anymore.\n\nSo the next time you feel something is still really tough, it might just mean you’re continuing to push the boundaries. Some endeavors are only worthwhile when they stay challenging, and a bit of discomfort is part of the journey.",

What happens next is what determines whether or not they become paying clients.\n\nMost people don’t go from “I just found you” to “here’s my credit card” overnight. They need more than information. Who are you? Do I like you? Can I trust you?\n\nWhile your degrees and credentials matter, just as important is how much they feel you get them. That you understand their struggles. That working with you feels like the right decision, not a risky one.\n\nThis is where your customer journey comes in. A well-thought-out journey moves people from curiosity → connection → commitment, so more of them say “Yes”.\n\nSo don’t just ask “How do I get more leads?”. Ask “How can I help my potential clients build trust and buy-in over time?”\n\nWe talk a lot about the mindset shifts your potential clients need to have before working with you…\n\nBut what if this is the mindset shift you need?",

This demonstrates the urgent need for a new leadership model that bridges technical expertise with human insights.\n\n WHAT'S NEW\n\n Traditional CIO/CTO roles prove insufficient for managing modern AI systems that adapt and evolve through user interaction\n\n A new leadership role - Chief Innovation and Transformation Officer (CITO) - bridges technical expertise with human insights\n\n Success with AI requires managing both systems and souls: technical implementation and human/cultural transformation\n\n Organizations need structured frameworks for implementing and governing AI that account for both technical and human dimensions\n\n BEYOND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE\nTHE NEED FOR A NEW LEADERSHIP MODEL\n\nAs we discussed in “TRANSCEND”, the challenge of implementing AI effectively extends far beyond technical prowess.\n\nLeaders responsible for AI implementation must be able to:\n\n Navigate Complex Ethical Landscapes: AI deployment requires careful consideration of ethical implications, bias mitigation, and alignment with organizational values.\n\n Foster Cultural Transformation: Successfully integrating AI means transforming organizational culture to embrace new ways of working and thinking.\n\n Manage Human-AI Collaboration: Leaders must understand both human psychology and AI capabilities to create effective partnerships between human workers and AI systems.\n\n Drive Cross-Functional Integration: AI implementation touches every part of an organization, requiring leaders who can work across traditional silos.\n\n Ensure Responsible Innovation: Leaders must balance the drive for innovation with careful consideration of potential risks and societal impacts.\n\nTraditional CIO and CTO roles, with their focus on technical implementation and system maintenance, are not structured to address these broader challenges.

It's about your mindset.\n\nAfter studying peak performers and diving into neuroscience.\n\nIve discovered growth isn’t just positive thinking.\n\nIt’s a systematic approach backed by decades of research.\n\nMost try forcing growth through willpower. Science shows a smarter path.\n\nHere are 5 research-backed methods that transformed my life:\n\n1️⃣ Pause and Reflect\nTake a moment to process the situation. Your brain rewires during reflection.\n\n Daily action: 10-minute journal. Ask \"What did today teach me?\"\n\n2️⃣ Reframe the Narrative\nChange your focus from “I failed” to “I’m learning.\n\n Daily action: Add \"yet\" to your limitations. \"I can't\" becomes \"I can't yet.\"\n\n3️⃣ Adjust and Strategize\nPinpoint what didn’t work and create a new plan. Failure is just rewiring your neural pathways.\n\n Daily action: Turn big goals into small experiments.\n\n4️⃣ Take Action and Persist\nGrit beats talent. Keep moving forward with purpose and determination.\n\n Daily action: One small step forward. Every day.\n\n5️⃣ Celebrate Small Wins\nProgress triggers dopamine. Motivation follows. Acknowledge every step forward, no matter how small.\n\n Daily action: List three wins before bed.\n\nThe truth? Growth isn't about big leaps. It's about small, scientific steps.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned:\n\nThe messiest times in life often lead to the most growth.\n\nHow do you approach growth?

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

Many thanks to,andfor creating such high quality content.\n\nThe event was well received, and as an organizer, I am humbled by the 4.8 out of 5 rating in the post-event feedback survey.\n\nI was also pleased to welcome many new institutional investors and to have the opportunity to guide them through the digital asset space.\n\nPlease reach out to me if you wish to attend our upcoming round tables.\n\nCan’t wait to see what this year brings!\n\nAmazing teamwork,and",

Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (all links in my comment below)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3 of this series.\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",

What better marketing for the University, Tesla, and the CyberTruck?\n\nThe kicker- along with their diploma, give them the title when they graduate. You’ll be able to see all the UT alums in every major city for years to come. What a way to reward all those athletes who want to stay?\n\nCome on Elon, let’s make this happen!

        "content": "BIOMIMICRY CONTINUUM – Part 4 – Update Agent LEARNING\n Fundamental evidence of learning is the ability to recall and utilize what is learned. Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (all links in my comment below)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3 of this series.\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",

This seems like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised with how many reps hear, “This isn't my department” and then simply hang up.\n\nIf you have someone on the phone, and they aren't the right person - at least ASK for the name of the right contact.\n\n\n2. Ask for an intro.\n\nI know it may seem scary, but you never know their answer until you TRY.\n\nThe way I phrase this on a cold call is very simple. It goes like this:\n\n“Appreciate you pointing me in the right direction there. I’m going to send an email to them right now. If it’s not too much to ask though - would you mind if I CCd you on that email, and you just replied there so they know we did in fact ACTUALLY speak haha?”\n\n\nThis play is not always going to work, but I’ve found if you actually MAKE the ask, and QUICKLY send over the email as promised - prospects really will reply.\n\nAnd if you don’t believe me - check out the email I received today.\n\nFor context: I cold called a prospect, he told me he wasn’t the right person, I explained how our product would help HIM, and I asked if he’d introduce me to his head of marketing.\n\nBoom. Intro made!\n\n,,,,,,,,,What do you do when the prospect you've called is not the right DM?",

        "content": "Navigating Uncertainty: Maintaining a Positive Mindset During Layoff Periods\n\nIn recent weeks, I've been reflecting on a challenge many of us in the professional world face: maintaining optimism and productivity while navigating the uncertainty of potential layoffs. Here are some insights I've gained from both personal experience and conversations with colleagues who've weathered similar storms.\n\nFirst, remember that your value isn't defined by your current employment status. Throughout my career, I've learned that professional setbacks often lead to unexpected opportunities for growth. Whether it's developing new skills, exploring different industries, or discovering hidden talents, periods of uncertainty can become catalysts for positive change.\n\nFocus on what you can control. While company decisions may be beyond our influence, we can control our response to the situation. I've found that updating my portfolio, strengthening professional relationships, and expanding my skill set not only helps maintain a sense of purpose but also builds resilience for whatever comes next.\n\nStay connected with your network, but be mindful of how you engage. Share knowledge, offer support to others, and maintain authentic relationships. Some of the most valuable connections I've made came from reaching out to help others during their challenging times.\n\nPractice self-care and maintain perspective. It's natural to feel anxious, but don't let worry consume your energy. Regular exercise, mindfulness practices, and setting aside time for activities you enjoy can help maintain emotional balance. Remember, your career is just one aspect of your life.\n\nMost importantly, keep showing up as your best self. Continue delivering quality work, maintain professional relationships, and stay engaged in your current role. This not only helps preserve a sense of normalcy but also demonstrates your resilience and professionalism – qualities that will serve you well regardless of the outcome.\n\nHave you faced similar situations? How do you maintain positivity during uncertain times? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences in the comments below.",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

        "content": "BIOMIMICRY CONTINUUM – Part 4 – Update Agent LEARNING\nFundamental evidence of learning is the ability to recall and utilize what is learned. Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (all links in my comment below)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3 of this series.\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",

        "content": "Something that's haunted me lately:\n\nI don't think people are prepared enough for the massive social disruption that AI is going to bring.\n\nLet me be brutally clear: Humans are no longer at the top of the economic food chain.\n\nWe are quickly losing the competitive advantages we had over the rest of the animal kingdom (rational thinking),\n\nand we are no longer the best resource that companies can leverage to create shareholder value.\n\nExecutives are licking their lips at decreasing their labour costs, increasing their operating margins and mitigating their risks.\n\nThe latest AI models are thinking at a PHD level and thanks to Deepseek getting smarter for exponentially cheaper than we thought.\n\nReplacing people with AI that don't need annual leave, care about DEI or pizza parties to keep them motivated.\n\nThe World Economic Forum's 'Future of Jobs' report claims 41% of global orgs will reduce jobs due to AI by 2030.\n\nThose jobs won't be fully replaced and people will struggle even further to make ends meet than they currently are under this fake 'non-recession'.\n\nOur public systems are already struggling and will likely be cut to reduce the massive debts incurred over the past 10 years.\n\nNo-one has a real plan for Universal Basic Income and employers will have their pick of the best displaced talent that are the most desperate for a job.\n\nThe critical mass of unemployed will default on their debts, have no means to provide for themselves and will take to the streets in survival mode.\n\nIt's dystopian and I hope I'm wrong, but I've already experienced what it's like to be cast away when the corporation doesn't need you anymore, even as a top performer.\n\nI started this business to fix the huge gap in tech sales education and to build a path out of the machine before it spits me out again.\n\nYour best bet to get ahead of this as a tech seller is to:\n\n1. Develop your high-value human skills (sales & EQ) in the highest leverage industry on the planet (tech) to stack cash and build towards FIRE (Financially Independent, Retire Early)\n2. Develop your own business to diversify income and build your way out\n3. Get entrenched in an organisation and be irreplacable - a high-level exec perhaps\n\nI think we've got 5 years before things really get rough, and I'll be stacking my cash & resources as much as I can before then.\n\nIf you're feeling the same and need help I can provide those high-value skills through Tech Sales Academy. Send me a DM and let's chat!\n\n~~~\n\n\nWatch the full ep of Building Tech Sales Academy in Public & also get 30+ free tech sales lessons on the Academy Youtube here:",

        "content": "\"You’re way ahead of where we are.\"\n\nThis comes up often when companies reflect on their AI and data strategy challenges. The reality? It’s less about being behind and more about navigating unfamiliar territory. Many organizations haven’t yet established a consistent, logical way to represent their data and workflows, making AI feel out of reach.\n\nBut the challenge isn’t at the peak of the mountain, it’s at the base. AI and data strategy aren’t about leaping ahead; they’re about taking deliberate steps toward making better decisions, improving efficiency, and staying competitive.\n\nMost businesses don’t need AI today. They need a clear, structured way to use their data effectively, so that AI, when the time is right, becomes the natural next step rather than an overwhelming leap.\n\nThe good news? The right tools, frameworks, and processes make this journey easier. What seems like a distant goal often becomes a structured, methodical process once the right foundation is in place.\n\nSo maybe the real question isn’t “Can AI work for us?” but rather “How do we ensure we thrive in an AI-ready world?”\n\nIf this resonates, let’s talk. A quick conversation can help clarify the best next steps: whether AI is on your immediate roadmap or if foundational data improvements make more sense right now.\n\nBook a call below or reach out and we can find some time to talk:",
