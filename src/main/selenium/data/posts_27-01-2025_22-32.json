      "content": "What problem are you helping your customers fix? If you can't answer this question, you will not close the deal. Here is what the best salespeople I work with do:\n\n1. They never talk about features (no one cares).\n\n2. They don't use cute-sey product names (no one knows what they are or why they matter).\n\n3. They are curious, they listen and they take time to formulate a high level, strategic solution to a complex problem.\n\n4. They assume the sale and insert themselves into next steps. (For example instead of \"what are the next steps\" they say: \"What I typically do is work with you to help Nancy from accounting understand the impact our partnership will have - does tomorrow at 2:00 work for the two of you?\" They are specific and action oriented without assigning \"homework\" to prospects).\n\nStop talking about features (no one cares)... and lean in to solving problems and watch your deal velocity improve....\nWhat did I miss?",

      "content": "\"Humiliation is a moment of humbling, narrated by the wrong person.\"\n\nThat statement was from a podcast my wife shared with me this morning.\nMan. That hits you in the feels.\n\nThe sting of humiliation often comes not from the moment itself,\nbut from the narrative we allow others to write about the experience.\n\nBy others - I am even talking about the voices in our head.\nWords that seem to be our own thoughts, but are just voices that spoke into our life - parents, teachers, adults, friends. Words that have become the narrative running in our heads.\n\nLike a story told through the wrong lens, humiliation distorts our perception of growth, casting shadows where there should be light.\n\nBut what if we seized the pen and rewrote the narrative?\n\nConsider this:\nEvery moment of humiliation - carries within it a seed of transformation.\n\nWhen we strip away the judgment of others – and often, our own harsh self-judgment – what remains is simply a moment of humbling... and in that humbling lies tremendous power.\n\nAs Nelson Mandela once reflected,\n\"Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.\"\n\nEach time we rise from self-perceived failure, we demonstrate not weakness, but extraordinary resilience.\n\nLike Kintsugi - the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, making the cracks part of the object's beauty, history and strngth - similarly, our moments of brokenness, when embraced and integrated, become golden seams of personal growth.\n\nMaya Angelou stated:\n\"You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.\"\n\nThe next time humiliation threatens to write your story, remember:\nStumbles are not your identity.\n\nThe true measure of character isn't in never falling, but in how we interpret and rise from those falls. After all, every moment of failure, is an invitation to grow stronger, wiser, and more compassionate. Failure is not final, rather it is a foundation of experience to build upon.\n\n\n\n• Can you think of 1 experienced failure, that proved life changing when you realigned because of it?",

      "content": "How to Stand Out in 2025: Stop Sounding Like Every Other Salesperson\n\nIn 2025, buyers are more informed than ever. They’ve done their research, compared options, and heard the same tired pitches from countless salespeople.\n\nThe truth? Buyers are tuning out the noise. The days of manipulation, pressure tactics, and generic value props are long gone. If you’re still sounding like every other company prospecting your clients, you’re not just blending in—you’re getting ignored.\n\nSo, how do you stand out?\n\nThe key isn’t in having the flashiest pitch or the loudest message. It’s in the way you approach the conversation.\n\n• Ask better questions: Instead of telling buyers why you’re different, ask them what’s holding them back from the results they want.\n• Make it about them: Prospects don’t care about your company’s accolades—they care about solving their specific problems.\n• Be curious, not pushy: When you approach the conversation with genuine curiosity, buyers open up. They feel heard, not sold to.\n\nStanding out isn’t about being louder; it’s about being more relevant. When you shift the focus away from yourself and toward guiding your prospect, you build trust—and trust leads to action.\n\nWhat are you seeing in buyer behavior this year? How are you adapting your approach to stand out in a crowded space? Let’s discuss.",

As a Chief of Staff, you’re often working behind the scenes, supporting others rather than being in the limelight.\n\n Do you thrive as the sole decision-maker?\n\nThe Chief of Staff role is all about supporting leadership and executing their vision strategically, not about having total control. If you prefer being the sole decision-maker, you may find this dynamic frustrating.\n\n Do you like networking and meeting new people?\n\nThe CoS needs to build relationships across teams, departments, and even external stakeholders. If networking feels draining or uncomfortable, this role might not play to your strengths.\n\n Do you prefer focusing on one thing at a time?\n\nThe CoS role is highly dynamic, with multiple tasks, priorities, and shifting challenges.

If you're more reactive than proactive, this job might not be a fit.\n\n Do you thrive on working solo?\n\nAs a CoS you work closely with leaders, teams, and other key stakeholders.

Nuestra historia, al igual que la muchos colombianos es de una lucha constante, marcada por la perseverancia y el deseo de mostrar al mundo lo mejor de nuestro país.\n\nHe sido testigo de cómo los empresarios colombianos se han levantado cada día a enfrentar desafíos titánicos. Han trabajado bajo la sombra del narcotráfico, la violencia, el contrabando y una imagen internacional que, por mucho tiempo, nos puso en desventaja. A pesar de todo, nunca dejamos de soñar, de innovar y de luchar por construir un futuro mejor.\n\nPermítanme darles dos ejemplos que cuentan la historia de nuestra resiliencia:\n\nHoy, Colombia es el mayor proveedor de flores para Estados Unidos, un negocio de 15 billones de usd en destino. De hecho, alrededor el 80% de las flores que adornan hogares, bodas y celebraciones en ese país provienen de fincas colombianas. Cada rosa, cada clavel, lleva consigo el esfuerzo de miles de colombianos que trabajan con dedicación.\n\nY, por supuesto, está nuestro café. No solo es uno de los más apetecidos y mejor pagados del mundo, sino que “Café de Colombia” se ha convertido en un símbolo nacional. Desde principios del siglo XX, los cafeteros colombianos trazaron un camino único, construyendo una estrategia de mercadeo que sigue siendo admirada en todo el mundo. A pesar de que Brasil es el mayor exportador, nosotros somos y seguiremos siendo el país cafetero. Porque no solo exportamos un producto, exportamos tradición, cultura y el sabor de nuestra tierra.\n\nEstados Unidos no es solo nuestro mercado más grande; es el escenario donde hemos demostrado nuestra capacidad para competir con los mejores, construyendo ventajas competitivas únicas frente a otros países que incluso están más cerca geográficamente que nosotros. Perder lo que hemos logrado sería un golpe devastador, no solo para nuestra economía, sino para el legado de generaciones de colombianos que han trabajado incansablemente para llegar hasta aquí.\n\nEs cierto que ayer domingo fue un día de mucha zozobra y lleno de incertidumbre. Pero algo ha quedado claro: los colombianos estamos cansados de la irresponsabilidad, de las promesas vacías y de los riesgos innecesarios.\n\nEs hora de unirnos como nación, de proteger el fruto del trabajo de aquellos que, con esfuerzo y sacrificio, han hecho posible que hoy Colombia brille en el escenario global. No podemos permitir que nos arrebaten lo que tanto nos ha costado construir.\n\nColombia no es solo un país; es una historia de lucha, pasión y esperanza.\n\n¡Vamos, Colombia! Y como siempre..\n\nQUE VIVA EL AGRO COLOMBIANO CARAJO!!!",
