      "content": "How did I earn shares in a FinTech startup, build two functions from the ground up, and then launch my consultancy‚Äîachieving six-figure profit in under six months, continuing to grow year over year?\n\nYears of learning, life-lessons and choosing a company with visionary leadership.\n\nThe kind of leadership that turns uncertainty and risk into opportunity. That keeps teams motivated when the stakes are high. That transforms employees into true stakeholders, fostering a shared sense of ownership and purpose. If employees have a stake in the company, they need leaders who are self-aware enough to understand that those employees should hold them accountable for their decisions.\n\nIn my case, this approach wasn‚Äôt just theoretical‚Äîit paid off in a very real way. I didn‚Äôt just earn shares; I realized them. Those shares became a tangible reward for the work I put into driving growth, navigating challenges and delivering results in a high-stakes startup environment.\n\nThat payout was more than a financial milestone‚Äîit was proof that everyone wins when leaders inspire collective accountability and empower their teams to invest in a shared vision. It was also a lesson that I could build for myself *and* others at the same time.\n\nI learned from the best (and the worst, but that's a story for another day). This mindset has fueled my career and shaped my journey.\n\nSo, here‚Äôs my challenge to you: If you're at a startup and/or you have shares in your company, don‚Äôt just hold them‚Äîown them. Ask questions. Expect answers. Advocate for yourself. Flourish in the shared success that true accountability can bring.",

Here's what they shared:\n\n\"AI isn't just replacing us‚Äìit's watching us first. 30% productivity gains at Salesforce?\n\nThat's from AI studying every workflow, every pattern, and every process.\n\nBenioff just announced: zero engineering hires in 2025, but 2,000 new salespeople instead?\n\nJanuary layoffs aren't random; they're evolutionary.\n\nThey need humans to sell what AI helps build.\n\nEverything feels like we're at an inflection point. Nothing about this feels optional. Nothing about this path seems reversible.\"\n\nWe're in the most transformative tech shift that any of us have experienced.\n\nYou weren't a genius when AI was just hype.\n\nYou weren't ready when AI was just watching.\n\nAnd you're not obsolete now that it's learning.\n\nWe're all part of this transition. Part of this evolution.\n\nYes, there are things we can do to adapt and thrive.\n\nBut also, remember to understand what's really happening:\n\nWhen AI can handle 80% of routine work by learning from our patterns, when Salesforce completely freezes engineering hiring but adds 2,000 salespeople, we're not just entering a new era.\n\nWe're entering the next phase of human-AI collaboration.\n\nThe question isn't if AI will change engineering.\n\nIt's how we'll evolve with it.\n\nLike every technological revolution, those who adapt first will shape what comes next.",

      "content": "7 hard truths about outbound in 2025:\n\nÔ∏è 1) Mass blast is destroying your TAM\n\nYou can never email a prospect who unsubscribes. You can never call a prospect on your do not call list. And you can never email ANYONE in a target account that blocks your company's entire domain.\n\nStop doing this to your buyers.\n\n\nÔ∏è 2) Buyers want way more from you before committing to a meeting\n\nWe've squeezed all of the juice out of: \"All we need is 15 min...\" Then it was 10 min. Then 5 min.\n\nThe ask for time can't get any shorter.\n\nThe value in return for time has to increase:\n\n- Site audits\n- Experiencing the brand\n- Sharing insights\n- Mystery shopping the brand\n- Surfacing insights from ICs/managers on their team\netc.\n\n\nÔ∏è 3) Well-written, customized, relevant, etc. cold emails aren't enough anymore\n\nThey just aren't. You could get 15-20%+ reply rates from okay cold emails that were personalized.\n\nInboxes are too cluttered. World-class cold emails aren't making it through as much anymore.\n\nYou have to be multi-channel: email, phone, social, physical mail, dropping by in-person, etc.\n\n\nÔ∏è 4) Your reps don't outbound because your front-line leaders don't know how\n\nMany front-line leaders crushed it from ~2010-2020. The economy was at an all-time HIGH. Everything was great.\n\nThey didn't have to outbound as much. They worked on teams that were over-hired with SDRs. And inbound was poppin'.\n\nThey never learned how to do outbound. And THAT is why your reps don't outbound.\n\n\nÔ∏è 5) Many reps are afraid to call cell phones\n\nI see this every week in training calls with large sales orgs.\n\nReps are asking: \"But isn't it weird to call someone's cell phone? Feels like I'm violating their privacy.\"\n\nSo what do they end up doing? Call general office lines. Talking all day to gatekeepers.\n\nOr worse, ditching the phone altogether.\n\n\nÔ∏è 6) It's hard to make cold calling work without a dialer\n\nPick-up rates are <5-6% for most sales teams right now.\n\nThat math just ain't mathin' for Account Executives.\n\n- 25 calls per day (takes about an hour) x 5 days per week = 125 calls\n- 125 calls x 5% pick-up rate = ~6 conversations\n- ~6 converations x 10-15% avg. conversion rate = 1 meeting\n\nYou'll get 3-5x+ that with a dialer.\n\n\nÔ∏è 7) The ceiling of outbound success is your marketing engine\n\nMarketing can't take credit for a sales-sourced meeting. It's too hard to track.\n\nBut I've never seen a great outbound org that didn't have world-class marketing.\n\nCold calling for a well-known brand like Shopify hits different than a startup no one's heard about before.\n\n\n~~~\n\n\nWhat would you add to the list?",

You won't regret living your values\n\nWe won't win because we are the smartest or the most advanced, or the most well funded, or the most connected.\n\nWe are going to impact things because we have cared about actually solving a real problem since Day 1.\n\nLast year after Unleash, we had over $1.5 million in sales pipeline, much of it progressing to close quickly. And as I was about to close deals, I found egregious errors that led me to realize, \"We gotta pull the plug.\"\n\nWe didn't sell software, on purpose.\n\nThis last year was a year of rebuilding following that. We made personnel changes. We redid the entire code base from end to end. We revamped our calculations.\n\nAnd now, we are bulletproof.\n\nThat delay brought stress.\n\nWe still sold services.\n\nBut we demonstrated we don't trade integrity for anything at OneView.\n\nWe make impact through data-driven analysis.\n\nThat starts with our willingness to be patient and make sound decisions, or else how can we help our customers do that?\n\n2nd point: You won't regret deeply creative thinking\n\nAs a consultancy turned productized bootstrapped startup, we have gotten \"around\" many norms and stipulations startups face.\n\nWe avoided big funding rounds, inflated valuations, unneeded dilution, and constant scrutiny of the plans we have been making before we \"knew it cold.\"\n\nNow we do, and the path has never been clearer.\n\nWe must always demand of ourselves the type of innovation we never thought was possible.\n\nWe have used every flavor of AI and technology imaginable, without yet needing certain full-time hires for unneeded things.\n\nAnd already we have analysis capabilities that quite literally don't exist anywhere else in the entire market (prove me wrong, I'll show you).\n\nWhat we sell next will change markets.\n\nBut the quality in that process is not just the outcome, it's the process itself.\n\nPeople say the destination is the journey, which can sound like excusing failure.\n\nFor my part, I believe living our values and thinking creatively are a journey that must be taken if the ultimate destination is to be achieved.\n\nWho is ready to come and see what we have been cooking up?",
