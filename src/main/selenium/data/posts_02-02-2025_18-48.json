        "content": "The Board's Critical Role in AI Investment Strategy: My AI Framework for Value Creation\n\nAs a CTO and board director overseeing digital transformations, I'm witnessing a pivotal moment in enterprise AI adoption. While vendors experiment with pricing models – some charging 60% premiums for AI features – the real challenge lies in governance and strategic alignment. Learn more here\nfrom my illuminatingLive conversation with, Former CEO, Board Director, Global Payments.\n\nHere's what I counsel every board must focus on:\n\nFirst, ensure management has clear objectives across the decision-making team. Recent conversations with fellow directors reveal that companies rushing into enterprise-wide AI deployments often lack defined success metrics. This isn't just about ROI – it's about strategic intent -Top-Line and Bottom-Line.\n\nThe key is aligning your AI portfolio to your short and long-term objectives including the competitive ambition:\n- Defensive investments (like productivity assistants) should demonstrate clear productivity and quality metrics\n- Competitive advantage plays require deeper integration with enterprise data and existing processes\n- Market-disrupting initiatives demand higher risk tolerance but could reshape entire industries\n\nWhat's particularly crucial is the board's oversight with insight and foresight. We must guide management beyond the procurement discussion through high-performance culture that ensures:\n1. Cross-functional collaboration between IT, business units, and risk management\n2. Regular assessment of progress against strategic objectives\n3. Clear frameworks for evaluating both tactical and strategic objectives\n4. Smart experimentation that doesn't require massive upfront investment\n\nAs one CIO () noted, \"Most companies overestimated how much more we would be willing to pay for an AI feature.\" The board's role is to ensure we're not just buying AI – we're investing in strategic capabilities that drive shareholder value.\n\nFor my fellow board directors:\n How is your board approaching the governance of AI investments?\n Are you satisfied with your framework for evaluating both tactical and strategic AI initiatives?\n Are we paying premium prices for features we could build internally at 1/10th the cost through Open Source?\n Are we measuring actual value, or just following the herd?",

        "content": "How to avoid common MVP pitfalls?\n\nWhen attempting to launch a product, the MVP is the version that has just enough features to:\n\n- Satisfy early customers\n- Test a product hypothesis\n- Gather feedback to inform future product development\n\nYes, the MVP can be a valuable tool to get to market quickly.\n\nBut it can also lead to unexpected obstacles and setbacks.\n\nConsider avoiding the following:\n\n1. 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:\n\nEven though the goal is to experiment and validate quickly, there are still certain features that are critical to a product’s success.\n\nBuilding too many features or spending too much time on the MVP development stage can lead to cost overruns and delays in the market launch.\n\n2. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫:\n\nBefore diving into building the MVP, take the time to fully understand the problem and identify your audience.\n\nIf the initial feedback from early users doesn’t match the product vision, it can be a sign that you’re off-track. Understanding your customer allows for a more targeted approach to product design and MVP launch.\n\n3. 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨𝐨 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤:\n\nWhile feedback is crucial to the development cycle, too much feedback during the early stages can cause product changes that don’t match the original goal or audience.\n\nFocus on making sure your core features work first and use feedback to test, optimize, and refine those features.\n\n\n\n4. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐔𝐗:\n\nUX design is essential, especially in product development. When users interact with an MVP, they expect a certain level of quality — a user experience that is intuitive and enjoyable.\n\nInvesting in UX will pay dividends in terms of usability and customer retention.\n\n5. 𝐈𝐠𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲:\n\nMaintaining an MVP with enough features to cater to early adopters and then scaling up with additional features, bug fixes, and other optimizations requires a unique approach.\n\nIf the code structure isn’t up to the task, adding new features could be a cumbersome and time-consuming process.\n\nThe key is to focus on building a product that will delight your customers and move you closer to reaching your product goals.",

A Stronger Personal Brand:\n\n↳ I went from being just another face in the crowd to being recognized for my expertise.\n↳ People now know me for the value I bring, not just the products I sell.\n\n2. Meaningful Connections:\n\n↳ Posting regularly helped me build relationships with like-minded professionals and potential clients.\n↳ Now, I connect with people who truly resonate with what I’m offering.\n\n3. Increased Engagement:\n\n↳ My posts get more likes, comments, and shares than ever before.\n↳ It’s not just about numbers, it’s about creating real conversations.\n\n4. Opportunities That Matter:\n\n↳ From collaboration offers to job opportunities, posting consistently has opened doors I never thought possible.\n\n Here’s why it’s working:\n\n1. Authenticity: I share what truly matters to me, not just polished, “perfect” content.\n\n2. Value: I focus on providing insights that help my audience, not just self-promotion.\n\n3. Consistency: Posting regularly keeps me visible and top-of-mind.\n\n Here’s my advice:\n\n↳ If you’re hesitant about posting on LinkedIn, just start.\n↳ Don’t worry about being perfect. Just be real, be consistent, and provide value.",

I ignored it for years.\n\nFor most of my LinkedIn life, I did what everyone else did.\n\nUpdated my profile.\nAccepted connection requests.\nBlocked my competitors.\nHid my connections.\nLogged out.\n\nMeanwhile, others were building brands, getting inbound leads, and unlocking insane career opportunities.\n\nI completely missed the pivot.\n\nThen, in 2021, I stumbled across something:\n\n People were posting daily\n They weren’t just “on” LinkedIn—they were using it\n They were landing deals, partnerships, and dream jobs\n\nSo, I jumped back in. With both feet.\n\n3️⃣ Old School Truths Bombs  About LinkedIn\n\nTruth  1️⃣ —> The Old Rules Were Ridiculous\n\nNo personal stories. No “opinions.”\nJust dry, corporate updates.\n\nToday?\nThe people winning here\nare real, raw, and unfiltered.\n\nTruth 2️⃣ —> It Used To Be Dirt Cheap\n\nLinkedIn Premium? $20/month.\nRecruiters had unlimited access for next to nothing.\n\nNow? You either build a brand or pay for visibility.\nAnd trust me—branding wins every time.\n\nTruth 3️⃣ —> It’s Still The Best Kept Secret\n\nMost people still think LinkedIn is just a job board.\n\nMeanwhile, others are building six-figure businesses,\nbecoming go-to industry experts, and never sending a cold email.\n\nBut Here’s The Part No One Talks About…\n\nNot all engagement is real.\n\nThere’s a wave of astroturfing happening.\nFake “pods” boosting posts, AI-generated content everywhere,\nand engagement rings making weak ideas look strong.\n\nAnd the biggest lie people believe?\n\nThat posting is enough.\n\nTruth is, posting without engagement\nis like speaking to an empty room.\n\nThe people actually winning?\n\nThey don’t just post.\n They comment.\n They start conversations.\n They build relationships, not just connections.\n\n18 years in, and I’m still learning, still adapting, still figuring it out.\n\nWhere were you 18 years ago?\nAnd when did you realize LinkedIn\nwas more than just an online resume?",

She had to take a call during the interview (it was her mum), this lady was raining curses on her mum, like there was no curse word She did not use that day. She was literally screaming on the phone.\n\nI'm sure you can guess what happened after the interview \n\nObviously, She didn't get the job.\n\nOn the flip side, I’ve seen people with 'just enough skill' rise quickly because their character made them unforgettable.\n\nCompetence gets you noticed; character gets you respected.\n\nCompetence helps you deliver; character makes people trust you.\n\nCompetence builds your resume; character builds your reputation.\n\nAs young professionals, we’re in a race to prove ourselves. But while we chase skills and expertise, let’s also build:\n\n Reliability – Do what you say you will do.\n\n Humility – Stay teachable, no matter how much you know.\n\n Integrity – Let your name be attached to excellence, always.\n\n Emotional Intelligence (This is extremely important)\n\nBecause at the end of the day, success isn’t just about what you do, it’s about who you become in the process.\n\nI'm, a Growth Marketer. I share my professional journey to empower young Marketers. I also share resources like Courses, Mentorship programs, Job opportunities to young professionals seeking Global opportunities.\n\nFollowfor more.",

𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀\n↳ Not just casual chats\n↳ Strategic questions like \"What was happening in your life when you decided to buy?\"\n↳ Looking for patterns across 5-7 conversations\n\n2. 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲\n↳ Study competitor accounts\n↳ Track what offers resonate\n↳ Map the conversation landscape\nPro tip: Use tools liketo do this effectively\n\n3. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽-𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀\n↳ Which emails convert better?\n↳ How do landing pages perform?\n↳ What patterns emerge from their social and shared content?\n\n4. 𝗘𝘅𝗶𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲\n↳ Why didn't they opt in?\n↳ What made them leave?\n↳ Single-question, laser-focused insights\n\n5. 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗦𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗲𝘆𝘀\nThe key with these?\nDon't just ask—ask with intention:\n↳ Use open-ended questions\n↳ Tie every question to a marketing goal\n↳ Keep it simple (busy people = short attention spans)\n\n𝗜’𝗺 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻 𝟯 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘄 -- website copy for a school, behavior-based, segmented welcome sequences for a personal development coach and nurtured-for-sales newsletters for a business coach.\n\nThe reason I can strategize and write ALL these assets in diverse niches? \"Listening\" to what their audience needs.\n\n𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 ...\n\nYou don’t 𝘢𝘭𝘸𝘢𝘺𝘴 need ALL 5 sources.\n\nSometimes, it’s a mix of 2-3.\n\nSometimes, they include other sources.\n\nBut at ALL times, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗜 𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿.\n\nAnd for 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 to happen … you need to be a scientist first and 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘯 a creative.\n\n𝗪𝗮𝗻𝘁  𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗱-𝘁𝗵𝗲-𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀 𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀?\n\nClick the link below my name to sign up for our newsletter, where we share our best \"make-more-sales\" strategies.\n\n--\n\n: Flashback pic of Pat and me from when I met him in San Diego to \"listen\" to him in-person.",

Emotional Intelligence → Practicing active listening builds empathy in any high-pressure environment. Stronger bonds = stronger teams.\n\n2. Time Management → The Pomodoro technique saved me. 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of rest. It’s simple but a game-changer for avoiding burnout.\n\n3. Building Meaningful Connections → It’s not about handing out business cards. It’s about asking thoughtful questions, sharing ideas, and offering value first.\n\n4. Resilience → Dwelling on mistakes only wastes time. Analyze what went wrong, improve, and keep moving forward.\n\n5. Conflict Resolution → Listen to every perspective, validate concerns, and solve the real problem. It’s a skill that pays off every single time.\n\nThese techniques aren’t “new” or “trendy.” But they’re timeless for a reason. They work.\n\nWhat’s one skill on this list you’d like to improve? Let me know in the comments.\n\nP.S. The basics always win. Could you stick to them? ",

Scaling is not.\n\nAnyone can add headcount, increase revenue, and expand operations.\nThe best leaders engineer scale—building systems that accelerate growth without creating friction, bottlenecks, or dependencies.\n\nThe difference between growing and scaling is the difference between temporary success and sustained dominance.\n\nIf you’re still operating like a high-growth startup, you’re already behind.\n\nHere’s what needs to change:\n\n5 Leadership Shifts to Stop Growing and Start Scaling\n\n1️⃣ From Execution to System Design\nScaling isn’t about doing more—it’s about building a company that functions without you. If you’re still deep in execution, you’re the cap on growth.\n\n2️⃣ From Hiring for Skill to Hiring for Leverage\nMore people doesn’t mean more output. The right hires create exponential value. The wrong ones create complexity and overhead. Build teams that scale impact, not workload.\n\n3️⃣ From Decision Bottlenecks to Distributed Ownership\nIf decisions still flow through you, you’re the problem. Scale requires decision velocity—leaders who create alignment so execution happens without slow approvals.\n\n4️⃣ From Optimization to Expansion\nYou can’t optimize your way to scale. Efficiency matters, but scaling demands aggressive bets, new markets, and repeatable growth loops. The real risk is moving too slow.\n\n5️⃣ From Founder-Led to Self-Sustaining\nThe ultimate test of scale: Does your company run without you? If you step away and things stall, you haven’t built a scalable business—you’ve built a fragile one.\n\nScaling = Systematic Growth. Growth = Linear Expansion. Which One Are You Building?\n\nIf you’re still caught in the ‘more people, more problems’ trap, you’re not scaling.\n\nThe best leaders don’t add complexity—they design for acceleration.\n\nWhat’s the biggest shift you need to make to scale?\n\n⬇️ Drop your thoughts in the comments.\n\nFollowfor more content on scale-ups, impact investment and transformative leadership.",

The pyramid consists of 15 blocks, each representing a different characteristic or trait, arranged in a hierarchical structure.\n\nThe foundation of the pyramid is built on five blocks: Industriousness, Enthusiasm, Self-Control, Alertness, and Initiative.\n\nThe next tier of the pyramid consists of four blocks: Intentness, Skill, Team Spirit, and Poise. These traits are built upon the foundation blocks and are essential for achieving success in team environments.\n\nThe third tier consists of three blocks: Confidence, Sincerity, and Imagination. These traits are critical for leadership and personal growth.\n\nThe apex of the pyramid is occupied by two blocks: Faith and Patience. These traits are essential for overcoming adversity and staying committed to one's goals.\n\nThe Pyramid of Success is a holistic model that emphasizes the importance of developing a strong foundation, building positive relationships, and cultivating leadership qualities to achieve success.",

The trading volume, the self-improving trading agents, the amount of AI being thrown into this ridiculous.\n\nSo here is the thing, the media is going to do their best (and pray) that this is \"Hauk tuah v2\". If it isn’t, that will attract capital from the middle east if it hasn't already. When the world realizes this is not Hauk tuah v2... things could go nuclear on liquidity.\n\nOne of the primary drivers for volatility: greed, fear, uncertainty. Welcome to the barn fire with the media fanning the flames.\n\nWith this amount of liquidity it is blood in the water for every technical trader on the planet, fresh alpha to the first movers, trading platforms are struggling to keep up with demand, and the global media (which hates Trump) is only going to make this worse (and help him ironically). For a game of politics, this could be the equivalent of Trump pulling out the Black Lotus, something you never thought was possible but now you're staring at it.\n\nIn America we tell ourselves we have a democracy, but this is a 'FUCK YOU' use of power at historical levels. Nancy Pelosi missed the inside scoop on this trade.",

𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬\n\nInstead of relying on a basic retrieval system, we can refine queries and retrieval strategies to improve accuracy and relevance.\n\nHere are four techniques that could enhance retrieval performance:\n\n 𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐲-𝐀𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐥\nUse named entities (e.g., people, locations, organizations) to refine search queries.\n Benefits: Improves precision by focusing on domain-specific terminology and reducing ambiguity.\n\n 𝐇𝐲𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐝 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐬𝐞-𝐃𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐥\nFor better relevance, combine sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) with dense vector search (embeddings).\n Benefits: Balances precision and recall, covering keyword-based and semantic search techniques.\n\n 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢-𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐥\nRetrieves documents iteratively, refining queries and filtering results in multiple stages.\n Benefits: Increases relevance for complex queries and eliminates noisy or duplicate results.\n\n 𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 (𝐇𝐲𝐃𝐄)\nGenerates a pseudo-document from the query before retrieval, improving search results.\n Benefits: Helps when queries are short, vague, or lack sufficient context.\n\n How These Techniques Improve RAG\n1️⃣ They increase recall, ensuring important documents aren’t missed.\n2️⃣ They reduce noise, preventing irrelevant or duplicate context from misleading the generation step.\n3️⃣ They handle complex queries better, allowing for better reasoning and improved search expansion.\n\n Key Takeaways\n Better retrieval leads to better generation—fix retrieval first!\n Simple techniques like entity-aware retrieval can drastically improve RAG results.\n\n️ Want to dive deeper?

Now, go lead a team to do the same. Aka -- do well and you're primed for promotion.\n\nREALITY: FFW 6 mo. and now you're leading a team of five but feeling shaky and anxious without guidance on the art of leadership itself.\n\n>> The Flaw <<\nThis method banks heavily on the idea that expertise in a specific area translates to effective team management.\n\nSOUNDS LIKE: Just share with everyone what you did in your territory the way you did it in theirs -- all strategy and implementation, no consideration of communication types, work types, strengths, etc.\n\nREALITY: What got you results as a sole contributor is often different than the communication, empathy, to strategic thinking that's required to lead others. We know this, right? So now what?\n\n>> The Fix <<\nStep 1: Recognize the gap and assess if leadership IS what you want -- and forgive yourself if being a sole contributor is 'your thing.' (Hey, it was for me, too.)\n\nStep 2: Square with the idea that it's time to learn to lead. What can you skill up on to get you there? Leadership is not gained by solo wins -- it's a distinct skillset that needs nurturing. There's a big difference in skill between a great worker and a great leader.\n\nSo HOW do you do it intentionally?\n\n>> Check out THIS episode to find out <<\n\n\n@Becky Wolfe offers a veritable mini-masterclass on better understanding your peers and leading from that deeper understanding.\n\nAnd listen, I'm greatly oversimplifying here but if you really want to lock in some leadership chops today -- listen to this episode.\n\n\nBecky shares great insights AND examples that will make you reconsider whether you really \"get\" your teams or colleagues -- or if you're hanging your leadership hat on what made you successful solo.\n\n\nAnd thank you Becky!\n__________\n\nAnd once you do -- tell me: Who are you? A creative? A guardian? Something else?\n\nWhat would you guess for Becky and myself?",

I was stuck in a cycle, always behind, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to catch up. My time was stretched thin, and I had zero extra money to even think about living the life I truly wanted. Stress was a constant companion. \nThen, I discovered something life-changing. I found a system that allowed me to earn in just 2 hours a day—without needing any tech skills whatsoever.  Even better, it’s completely automated, meaning I can enjoy my life while still making money every single day without being tied down. \nThis isn’t just another \"quick fix\"—it's a global opportunity with no monthly fees and a proven blueprint for success. The Legacy Builders Program is not just a way to make money, it’s a path to true freedom. It shows you exactly what to do step by step, giving you the tools and support you need to achieve the life you’ve always dreamed of. \nThe best part? You’re not in this alone—there’s full support every step of the way. And the results speak for themselves: more time, more financial freedom, and the ability to build the future you’ve always imagined. \nI’m beyond thankful for this program because it gave me back something priceless—my time, my peace of mind, and the ability to truly enjoy life. The struggle I once felt is now a distant memory. And if you’re tired of feeling stuck or trapped in the cycle, know that change is possible—and it starts with taking that first step.\nImagine a life where you can wake up without stress, live with purpose, and build the future you deserve.  You can have it. Your journey toward freedom and success starts now. Don’t wait—take the leap and start creating the life you’ve always wanted. go to\n\"",

I got to speak on a panel with peer VCs to a group of founders, engineers, and investors. I also met with a number of ambitious entrepreneurs who I am excited to dig in with.\n\nTO BE HONEST: I spend most of time sourcing and interacting with companies based in the major markets (NY, SF, LA). The numbers don't like: ~75% of US-based venture-backed unicorns call one of those 3 cities home.\n\nDIAMOND IN THE ROUGH: However, that means 25% are elsewhere! I love hustling and working on things that nobody is paying attention to (zig when everyone zags). Utah is a prime example of that, it is loaded with tech talent + high integrity, disciplined operators.\n\nALSO: Shameless plug for two of our Utah-based portcos that are crushing it and growing rapidly:and. Check them out!\n\nLooking forward to my next trip to Utah and partnering further with the ecosystem there.\n\n(Week 5/52)",
