It's easy to get caught up in the pressure to perform, to hit our numbers, and to succeed.\n\nBut here's the thing: success isn't just about achieving our goals. It's about how we achieve them.\n\nWhen we prioritize doing the right thing - even when it's hard, even when it's unpopular - we build trust, we build credibility, and we build strong relationships.\n\nIf one of these tough decisions have been eating at you last year, take a stand and make it right it your life or business.\n\nWhat's one area in your business or personal life where you can focus on doing the right thing?\n\nIs it being more transparent with your customers?\n\nIs it taking a stand on a tough issue?\n\nIs it simply being kind and compassionate to those around you?\n\nWhatever it is, I encourage you to take action.\n\nDoing the right thing isn't always easy.

        "content": "Jevon's Paradox and Its Significance to Nvidia:\n\nNVIDIA's dominance is only going to be further reinforced by DeepSeek's arrival. How?\n\nThe principle that supports this is known as Jevon's Paradox. Jevon's Paradox states that as a resource becomes more efficient, the consumption of that resource amplifies. In this case, as AI model training becomes more efficient, AI model training will become more accessible and higher in demand.\n\nThink of how many companies thought they wouldn't be able to train llms due to the sheer cost of them. DeepSeek is paving the way forward in showing they CAN do so, and they won't need the expensive compute resources to get to the result they want. They don't need to leverage OpenAI's models or third party open-source models as much. In the end, who benefits? Nvidia.",
