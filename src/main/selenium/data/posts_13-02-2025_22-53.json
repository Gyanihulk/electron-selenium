And that’s not a bad thing.\n\nDon’t confuse \"elite\" with \"experienced.\" They are often not the same. Elite engineers are not necessarily the senior engineers. The middle producers of all levels of experience....the average software developer....the ones more commonly referred to as the 0.1x developers. Those jobs are going away fast. And it's not a bad thing.\n\nElite engineers will thrive. AI doesn’t replace them—it multiplies their impact. With more leverage than ever, they’ll build bigger, faster, and smarter. The wheels of progress don’t stop turning.\n\nThe future belongs to those who embrace it. Adapt, evolve, and find new ways to create value—because the shift isn’t coming. It’s already here.",

Who doesn't want to be considered super SMART?!\n\nWe also dove into a topic that affects a lot of business owners (and parents in general): work/life balance—or should I say, the myth of it. As a mom of four, entrepreneur, and someone who thrives on a packed calendar, I’ve learned that balance isn’t about juggling everything perfectly at once. Instead, it’s about seasons—knowing where to put my focus at any given time and being fully present in that moment. Sometimes it’s all about my businesses; other times, it’s all about my girls. And let’s be real… sometimes, it’s just about finding five minutes to drink my coffee while it’s still hot. ️\n\nIf you’re navigating the same challenges—whether in leadership or just trying to keep all the plates spinning—this episode is for you. \n\nListen here:\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! What does balance look like for you?",

        "content": "SaaS growth is all sunshine and ARR milestones on LinkedIn.\n\n\nBut behind the scenes? It’s mostly duct tape, existential crises, and a slow march toward burnout.\n\nEveryone flexes about their latest funding round. No one talks about:\n The burn rate that could set off fire alarms.\n Churn rates that make you wonder if customers are allergic to your product.\n Feature creep that turns your once-sleek SaaS into Frankenstein’s monster.\n\nSince I apparently enjoy self-inflicted pain, I started Clientell—where we build AI agents to help companies actually manage their salesforce instead of drowning in admin work. And let me tell you, scaling a SaaS company is NOT for the weak.\n\nLet’s break down the ugly truths:\n‍ 1. Growth ≠ Profitability (But VCs Don’t Care)\nInvestors love ARR—until they realize you’re spending $5 to acquire every $1. But hey, just raise another round, right? Problem solved.\n\n 2. Churn: The SaaS Version of a Horror Movie\nFounders celebrate new ARR like it’s free money. Meanwhile, customers are ghosting them faster than a bad Tinder date.\n\n 3. Feature Creep: When Your Product Becomes a Swiss Army Knife of Doom\nIt starts with “Can you just add this one little thing?” Next thing you know, your UI looks like NASA’s mission control, and no one—not even your engineers—understands what your product does anymore.\n\n 4. Hiring Too Fast, Firing Too Slow\nStep 1: Raise funding.\nStep 2: Hire like you're building the Avengers.\nStep 3: Realize your burn rate is insane.\nStep 4: Layoffs. (But make sure to post a heartfelt LinkedIn update about it.)\n\n 5. Losing Touch with Customers\nEarly-stage? You know every user by name. Later-stage? Support tickets get buried under 5 layers of \"escalations\", and customers start plotting their escape.\n\n🆘 6. Support is Treated Like a Cost Center (Until Customers Revolt)\nSlow response times. Automated “We’ll get back to you” emails. A help center that’s about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Shocking that customers leave, huh?\n\n 7. Founder Burnout is a Feature, Not a Bug\nScaling isn’t just “hard.” It’s the business version of running a marathon while being chased by wolves.\n\n TAKEAWAY:\nSaaS growth at all costs is just a fancy way of saying “We’ll figure it out later.” And “later” usually means layoffs, panic pivots, or a surprise existential crisis.\n\nHave a SaaS horror story? Drop it in the comments. Or just tell me I’m wrong—either way, I promise I won’t ghost you. ",

        "content": "I turned down every VC check for 12 years to keep 92% ownership of Groove. It has proven to be the best decision of my life.\n\nHere's the math:\n\nWhile VCs are pushing founders to split ownership down to 5% chasing unicorn dreams, independent founders are quietly building $5M ARR businesses they own 92%+ of.\n\nI've seen both sides. And here's the math nobody talks about:\n\nVC Path:\n\n- Give up 95% ownership\n- Split decision making\n- Lose control of vision\n- Raise endless rounds\n- Hope for unicorn exit\n- Maybe get $50M\n- If you're lucky (<1% chance)\n\nIndependence Path:\n\n- Build with customer money\n- Keep 92% ownership\n- Run profitable (50% EBITDA)\n- $5M ARR\n- $2.5M/year in your pocket\n- Complete control always there\n- Freedom to choose direction\n\nThesis: Simple math of a $5M boostrapped ARR beats the promised story of a unicorn exit. The reason?\n\n1. it's achievable (many have done it)\n2. it's profitable (50% EBITDA)\n3. it's yours (no board approval)\n4. it gives options:\n- work your way or their way\n- sell for $30M or scale to $100M\n- take profits or reinvest everything\n\nWe've built Groove this way:\n\n- clear focus: sustainable SaaS $5M-$10M ARR\n- real moats: ownership, profit, control\n- actual freedom: every decision is ours\n\nVCs sell you unicorn dreams\n\nBut bootstrappers are building generational wealth\n\nThe real win isn't a unicorn exit.\n\nIt's complete freedom with generational wealth.\n\nThat's why 92% ownership is the new standard.\n\nLet VCs chase their 1% dreams.\n\nSmart founders are choosing 92% of something real.\n\nBuild for freedom, not exits.",

And yeah, sometimes that means using strong language \n\nA lot of people get uncomfortable with \"bad words,\" but language is meant to express emotion. When someone drops an f-bomb in the middle of a story, it’s usually not just for shock value. It’s because they’re feeling something deep, intense, and real.\n\nI’ve seen it over and over—people in professional settings using strong language in conversations, business deals, even in high-stakes moments. Why? Because sometimes, no \"proper\" word carries the same punch.\n\nAt the end of the day, language is a tool. Use it wisely, use it authentically, and don’t be afraid to let it hit where it needs to \n\nWhat do you think—are strong words just bad language, or do they actually add emotional impact?\n\nt",

Be where they are and focus on marketing, sales, and developing new features for the people who actually need your product. Thanks for this insight;)\n\n2️⃣ Marketing and sales are a multichannel effort. This is whattold me. Attend events, publish valuable articles, and host webinars. Decisions are no longer made in a single interaction.\n\n3️⃣ Want to grow your network? Don't sell yourself, be valuable to a community of people. Post articles and share insights that truly resonate with your (ICP) audience.\n\n4️⃣ Don't create yet another AI wrapper. AI tools can help you validate your business idea in the market, so use them wisely, but build something that isn’t easy to copy. Nowadays, anyone can create something around ChatGPT.\n\n5️⃣ Automatic outreach is dead. A few years ago, people thought they could get customers through automatic outreach. Now, LinkedIn is just a bunch of bots liking each other's stuff. Focus on real interactions. Go to events, talk with the right people, and ask them how you can help them.\n\nThanks,,,,,,,,, and others I forgot to mention for the great conversations! ",
