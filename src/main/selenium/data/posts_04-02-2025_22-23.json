Clear priorities so every department moved toward the same destination.\n Checkpoints along the way. Milestones and communication cadences to keep teams in sync.\n Cross-team incentives. Success was redefined as collective progress, not individual wins.\n\nThe result?\n\nHis team stopped pulling in different directions and started accelerating together.\n\nProductivity soared, friction decreased, and Benjamin no longer felt like a referee in a game with no rules.\n\nIs your team driving in different directions?\n\nAlignment isn’t about forcing people to follow orders—it’s about making sure they want to move together.\n\nWith only 2 spots left in the Feb 6th vWorkshop, now’s the time to master the strategies that make alignment natural.",

From harnessing the power of AI to forging key partnerships, this year was all about empowering healthcare providers to succeed in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nOne of the biggest milestones for us was the introduction of Anonymous Patient Surveys. We wanted to give healthcare providers a way to build trust with their patients, so we focused on creating an environment where candid feedback could be shared without hesitation. This honest feedback is what helps healthcare providers improve and grow.\n\nAnother proud achievement was the launch of CommentWiz, our AI-powered tool designed to help healthcare providers gain smarter, more insightful feedback. It’s all about using the power of artificial intelligence to give providers a clearer understanding of patient sentiments and enabling them to make data-driven decisions.\n\nOn the partnership front, we took a major step forward by teaming up with Kalix. This collaboration has helped streamline patient care and provider workflows, ensuring smoother interactions for both patients and healthcare professionals.\n\nIt’s been an incredible year of unlocking insights into patient preferences, sharing essential industry knowledge, and connecting with thought leaders. And as we look ahead to 2025, we’re more excited than ever for what’s next.\n\nI’m so proud of the strides we’ve made, and I can’t wait to continue this journey.\n\nCatch the full story here!",

        "content": "Small actions, big impact. When it comes to climate change, many believe that only sweeping policies and large-scale initiatives can make a difference. But in reality, microactions—small, consistent choices made by individuals—hold immense power. From reducing single-use plastics to making conscious energy choices, these incremental steps create a ripple effect that influences communities and industries alike.\n\nBy adopting microactions, individuals contribute to a larger movement without feeling overwhelmed. Simple habits like choosing reusable bags, supporting sustainable brands, or reducing food waste add up over time. When multiplied across millions of people, these everyday decisions drive real change, shaping demand for greener products and pushing businesses to adopt sustainable practices.\n\nThe power of microactions lies in their accessibility. No grand gestures are required—just consistent, mindful choices that align with a more sustainable future. When people recognize that their daily behaviors matter, they become part of a collective force that challenges the status quo. Climate action isn’t reserved for policymakers or corporations; it begins with the small, intentional steps taken every day.\n\nTo watch the entire Human-AI Symbiosis with  Cedric Chin and Lia DiBello Ph.D on the Commoncog podcast, click here -",

        "content": "Today \nhashtag\n#CyberTalent spotlight is on Lisa Ventura \n\nWhat was your original career path and how did you end up in the cyber security field?\n\nI spent many years working in the entertainment industry with Chris Tarrant, the host of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” in the UK, but I took the decision to join my first husband’s cyber security software development company in 2009. I was actively involved in all areas of the business until we separated and subsequently divorced in 2012. After this, I founded the UK Cyber Security Association.\n\nℹ️ What is the most appealing thing to you about working in cyber security?\n\nI love the fact that everything in cyber security makes a huge difference. If I can help to stop businesses of any size from getting breached or suffering a cyber-attack through raising awareness of the importance of cyber security and of the growing cyber threat, I will be happy.\n\n Name a book/movie that has inspired you. Anything specific to cyber security that you would recommend?\n\nI am a HUGE fan of Queen and grew up with the band from the moment I was born. When I first saw the film “Bohemian Rhapsody” and heard the line “fortune favours the bold”, it resonated with me completely. I tend to read a lot of non-fiction books to learn new skills and keep them up to date, and I recently read Dr Jessica Barker’s book “Confident Cyber Security”, which is very insightful if you are new to the industry and looking at how to get started.\n\n I recommend you to follow her , like and comment on this post to share her example, and perhaps suggest others to showcase !\n\n>>> This profile is part of a series I’m publishing every other day in collaboration with @Women4Cyber Foundation, follow me to receive the next updates.",

With the proper structure and authorities, and clarity of direction - yes, this approach will lead to sustainable growth.\n\nMy philosophy is to create a solid day day 'engine' that takes care of itself, while leadership focusses on the future, analyzes trends, and feeds the 'day to day'. And when something significant changes, you've simply created a new 'day to day'.\n\nThe term synergy has been taken as a magical chemical like reaction that occurs when multiple aspects come together. There's nothing magical about growth - just structure (foundation), focus (strategy), and humble commitment.",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

But over time, I realized something: great work alone isn’t enough.\nClients stay when they trust you. And trust isn’t built through one-off transactions-it’s built through consistency, communication, and genuine care.\n\nHere’s what’s helped me:\n\n Actually Listen (Not Just Hear)\nEarly on, I used to jump straight into solutions. But the best client relationships come when you take a step back, really listen, and ask the right questions. Sometimes, what they say they need isn’t actually what they need. Understanding that difference makes all the difference.\n\n Set Expectations Clearly (and Stick to Them)\nNothing ruins a relationship faster than misaligned expectations. I’ve learned to be upfront about timelines, challenges, and deliverables—because a tough conversation now is better than a tough situation later.\n\n Be Proactive, Not Just Responsive\nThe best way to build trust? Solve a problem before they even realize it exists. Whether it’s offering insights, flagging potential roadblocks, or just checking in before they have to ask—it shows you genuinely care about their success.\n Clients Are People, Not Just Accounts\nThis one is big. At the end of the day, relationships matter more than transactions. A quick check-in, a personal touch, or even just remembering small details about them makes all the difference. The best client relationships feel more like partnerships than contracts.\n\n Follow-Ups Are Everything\nI’ve seen great conversations fade into nothing simply because no one followed up. A quick message, a helpful resource, or just a simple “Hey, how’s everything going?” keeps the connection strong. Clients appreciate knowing they’re more than just a deal.\n\n Final Thought: Clients don’t leave because of price or even competition most of the time. They leave when they feel unheard, unvalued, or like just another number. Treat them like people, and they’ll stay for the long run.",

The ones...\n\n... with  deep domain knowledge in your industry\n\n... with  strong product management skillsets\n\nIf you are lucky, you can get both together. They are rare, though, so don't wait to find them unless you are in a rush! These unicorns are rare - and even in the current recruiters market the opportunity cost is huge.\n\nThe anti-pattern I see is that people hire focused on domain knowledge because the candidates sound knowledgeable about the industry in the interview, and it's easy to assess that as someone embedded in the industry.\n\nAssessing product management skills, on the other hand, is much harder and requires the interviewer(s) to step out of their comfort zone!\n\nIn general, if there is one thing you won't be short of in your company is industry knowledge. And a great PM will learn that in very little time from all the other people who are already there. Heck coming in with fresh eyes can also be valuable to question some assumptions!\n\nWhat is much rarer is strong product management skills.\n\nHire for strong product management skills, and teach them deep domain knowledge!\n\n\n\n——-\nHi, I’m Phil.  My mission is to help product leaders think, make decisions and take action that drives outcomes.\n\nLet’s connect!\n\n️ Like if this resonates\n️ Repost for your network\n Follow me to see more posts like this",

The assumption that domain expertise automatically makes someone a great PM is like hiring a race car driver just because they know a lot about engines, when what you really need is someone who knows how to win the race.\n\nGreat PMs are like master chefs. You don’t hire them because they know one cuisine inside out - you hire them because they can understand ingredients, balance flavors and create a winning dish no matter what.\n\nHire a chef who can cook, not just someone who knows your kitchen.\n\nHere’s why:\n1) Skill > Domain: A PM who excels at prioritization can triage features for a fintech app just as effectively as for a farming SaaS tool.\n\n2) Fresh Eyes = Fresh Wins: Domain-new PMs often ask “Why can’t we?” instead of “Why shouldn’t we?”\n\nYes, domain knowledge matters. But product thinking, prioritization, problem-solving and execution? Those are the real game-changers.",

        "content": "I made a hiring mistake that set us back an entire year. It wasn’t because the person was incompetent—it was because they thought certain tasks were beneath them.\n\nA VP of Sales unwilling to jump on a customer call. A VP of Engineering hesitant to dive into code reviews. A marketing exec too quick to outsource to an agency instead of getting their hands dirty.\n\nIt often happens when hiring based on pedigree—big-name companies and impressive resumes—without truly assessing their willingness to operate at the level an early-stage startup demands as they perhaps once did.\n\nThat’s why I now rely on “Ego Breaker” interview questions. Simple exercises that mimic the work of an individual contributor on their team:\n• A VP of Engineering tackling a simple coding challenge.\n• A Head of Sales role-playing an outbound call.\n• A VP of Marketing doing some back-of-the-envelope funnel math.\n\nThe responses fall into three categories:\n1️⃣ They refuse—either because they can’t or because they think it’s below them. \n2️⃣ They try but struggle—showing effort but limited ability.\n3️⃣ They dive in and excel—demonstrating both skill and willingness.\n\nI’m not expecting perfection. Unused skills atrophy over time. But in an early-stage startup, the right executive needs the humility and willingness to roll up their sleeves.\n\nOf course, some argue that asking these kinds of questions is unfair—that an executive’s job is to lead, not execute. That these tests don’t reflect the strategic vision, coaching, or scaling expertise a great leader brings. I hear that. But in a startup, there is no room for ivory tower leadership. The best executives I’ve worked with have no problem proving they can do what they ask of their teams.\n\nAre these questions a fair test—or an unnecessary hurdle that drives away top talent?",

Believe in yourself\n↳ Stop waiting for permission - your gut instinct is usually right, and others are waiting for someone to go first\n\n2. Vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness\n↳ The conversations you're afraid to have are the ones your team needs most - open up first\n\n3. See good in others\n↳ The talent you spot today becomes the game-changer nobody saw coming tomorrow\n\n4. Tell the truth\n↳ Trust isn't built in board rooms, it's built when honesty costs something\n\n5. Courage is about being willing to try\n↳ Being scared and being brave feel exactly the same - the only difference is what you do next\n\n6. Happiness is a choice\n↳ Your mood isn't just your mood - it's the foundation others build their day on\n\n7. Winning is an attitude\n↳ Winners aren't born with more talent - they just punch fear in the face more often\n\n8. Optimists do more\n↳ While pessimists are still explaining why it won't work, optimists are already making it happen\n\n9. Be a Goldfish\n↳ You can't control what happens, but you can control how long you let it matter - reset like a goldfish\n\n10. All people are different people\n↳ Surround yourself with people who think differently - echo chambers kill innovation faster than failure ever could\n\n11. Stay teachable\n↳ The moment you become the smartest person in the room is the moment you need a new room\n\n12. Doing the right thing is never the wrong thing\n↳ Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. Your integrity isn't negotiable\n\nRemember:\nAverage leaders focus on results.\nGreat leaders focus on energy.\n\nYour attitude isn't just how you show up.\nIt's how you transform every room you enter.\n\nP.S.

        "content": "If there’s one thing co-founding a company has taught me, it’s this: \n\nDon't avoid disagreements.\n\nDisagree well.\n\nDisagreements, when handled the right way, can lead to incredible outcomes.\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of working on my upcoming book—co-authored with my business partner—has been the ability to hash out different opinions and come away with something far stronger than what either of us could have created alone.\n\nHere’s a simple example:\n\nMy co-author self-identifies as an optimist.\nI do not.\n\nThis difference has sparked countless conversations—sometimes over specific word choices or small details that, in reality, are indicators of tone and meaning.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nEvery time we’ve leaned into these differences, openly hashed them out, and truly listened to each other, the final product has been better.\n\nThis experience reminded me of something I practice often: the 3 C’s of Collaborative Disagreements:\n\n1️⃣ Curiosity: Approach disagreements with an open mind. Instead of defending your perspective, ask open-ended and clarifying questions ⇢ seek to understand before sharing or debating.\n\n2️⃣ Clarity: Break down the disagreement. Is it about goals, process, or execution, ask clarifying questions. Looping and checking for understanding helps ensure aligned clarity. Clarity creates focus.\n\n3️⃣ Compromise: Be willing to meet halfway when it strengthens the outcome. There are hills you are willing to die on, but far too often we are disagreeing miles away from those hills — if it isn't deeply important to one or both of you it isn't worth an argument.\n\nStudies support this approach. Research from Harvard Business Review shows that teams with constructive conflict are more likely to innovate and outperform their peers because they embrace diverse perspectives.\n\nCollaboration isn’t about always agreeing—it’s about learning from one another, pushing each other, and letting those different perspectives lead to something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe lesson? Disagreements, when approached with curiosity and mutual respect, aren’t roadblocks—they’re opportunities for creativity and innovation.\n\nHow do you handle disagreements in your collaborations?",
