Or coach. And mentor. And give feedback. Not be stuck in email hell.\n- Allow the work we do to be more human and flexible.\n\nAll are spot on but #2 is where companies go VERY wrong...\n\nWe somehow expect managers to know how to lead because we promote them. All while ignoring that leadership training and development is either non-existent or bare minimum at best. There's just no leadership from leadership!\n\nSo, if we're going to make something mandatory... shouldn't it leadership training, not returning to the office???\n\nWe need to ensure leaders are:\n\n- Capable of leading teams with approaches that serve instead of dictate.\n- Capable of managing performance based on actual outcomes instead of observation.\n- Capable of establishing trust with employees to actually manage people that drives engagement.\n- And making sure the people that are leaders, aren't solely in it for power and authority.\n\nBecause the numbers don't lie:\n\n+ 70% of the variance in employee engagement is directly tied to the manager (Gallup).\n+ 58% of managers report they never received any leadership training (CareerBuilder).\n+ Companies that invest in leadership development see a 25% increase in organizational outcomes (Center for Creative Leadership).\n\nLeaders are the central nervous system of the organization.\n\nThey are how employees understand what is excepted (for better or worse).\n\nLeaders ARE engagement.\n\nSo let's equip them to be better, not worse!\n\nWho's with me?",
