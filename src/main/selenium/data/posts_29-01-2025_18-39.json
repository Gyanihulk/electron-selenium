        "content": "Everyone thinks Elon Musk started Tesla.\n\nThey're wrong.\n\nInstead, he used a genius acquisition strategy that made him the world's richest man.\n\nHere's how:\n\nIn 2003, two engineers started Tesla Motors with a vision to create high-performance electric cars.\n\nBut they needed capital.\n\nEnter Elon Musk.\n\nHis first move?\n\nLead the Series A with $6.35M, becoming the largest shareholder and board chairman.\n\nThen he did something brilliant.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, with Tesla weeks from bankruptcy, Musk stepped in as CEO and made three game-changing decisions:\n\n• Laid off 24% of the workforce\n• Invested more of his own money\n• Started building everything in-house\n\nThat last move became Tesla's secret weapon.\n\nWhen the 2021 chip shortage hit, most automakers had to halt production.\n\nTesla rewrote their software in 2 weeks to support different chips and kept producing while competitors struggled.\n\nThe results speak for themselves:\n\n• Tesla's profit margins: 25.6%\n• Industry average: 17%\n\nBut Musk's most brilliant move was turning his personal brand into Tesla's biggest marketing engine.\n\nA single Musk tweet about Tesla correlated with:\n\n• 1.1% increase in stock price\n• 6.9% increase in trading volume\n\nCost of this marketing? $0.\n\nHere's the blueprint Elon used:\n\n• Start as an investor, not founder\n• Focus on the bigger vision\n• Control the entire supply chain\n• Build a powerful personal brand\n\nBut here's what most people miss:\n\nThe real power move isn't starting from scratch.\n\nIt's finding existing businesses with proven track records and taking them to the next level.\n\nAfter acquiring 8 companies myself, I've learned that the greatest deals are:\n\n• Profitable but unsexy\n• Primed for growth\n• Owner-operated\n\nThe best opportunities are often hidden in plain sight\n-\n\nIf you enjoyed this post:\n\n️ Reshare for others who might find it useful\n Follow me, Walker Deibel for more\n Share your thoughts below ",

Really??\n\nIn 1995 Musk, his brother Kimbal and Greg Kouri started Global Link Information Network, later renamed Zip2.\nCompaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999 and Musk received $22 million for his 7 percent share\n\nIn March 1999, Musk co-founded, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.merged with Confinity which brought PayPal into the company. In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk, PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares, received $176 million.\n\nMusk founded Space X in 2002.\n\nMusk only got involved in Tesla in 2004 when he lead the Series A.\n\nSo prior to this involvement in Tesla he had already founded 3 companies with 2 exits under his belt, So kindly elaborate on how Musk started as an investor and not a founder.",

Yes, All I'm sayin is that Musk, a revered, successful, and iconoclastic entrepreneur understands that innovation and acquisition are equally important. \n\nMusk acquired Paypal, Tesla, and X.\n\nBut Edwin, you are absolutely correct that he started and sold Zip2. He successfully started from scratch first. It's just not the only path.\n\nAfter selling Zip2, he bought a McLaren. ; )",

Think of data centers as the “brains” running AI. They need tons of power to function. Instead of using dirty fuels, these centers will now tap into renewable energy.\n\n Clean energy, cleaner planet. By using solar and wind farms, this plan helps fight climate change while supporting cutting-edge tech.\n\n Innovation meets sustainability. This isn’t just about tech, it’s about creating jobs, driving the economy, and building a greener future for everyone.\n\nThe idea is simple: Support the growing tech world while protecting the planet.\n\nIt’s exciting to see how smart planning can lead to big changes, don’t you think?\n\nLet’s keep an eye on how this shapes our world.",

So assume anything you are sending in could be made freely available to your biggest competitor or a hacker. Better yet, host your own instance.

These students—at just 19-21 years old—are doing much more than I was at that age (and honestly, maybe more than I did last year). They weren’t just pitching ideas; they were running legitimate businesses, taking risks, and proving why the future of entrepreneurship is in good hands.\n\nWe judged them based on EO’s Core Values, and they did not disappoint:\n\n Trust and Respect– Treating each member with equality and valuing diverse perspectives.\n Thirst for Learning – A constant curiosity to acquire new knowledge and grow.\n Think Big, Be Bold – Embracing innovation and taking calculated risks to make a significant impact.\n Together We Grow – Commitment to supporting each other's success and well-being.\n\nEvery single competitor brought their A-game, but our winners stood out:\n\n1st Place:, Rutgers Honors College student and CEO of, a dorm & apartment security system that fits right over the door handle. Smart, inexpensive, and something I’ll absolutely be buying for my daughters when they head to college! Anjo’s already built an executive team, launched multiple non-profits, and is heading to Puerto Vallarta to compete at the next level!\n\n2nd Place:, Rowan University student and Founder of—a sustainable, boutique makeup brand with a mission to empower through representation.\n\n The Other Competitors Were Just as Impressive:\n\nCirclez –: A project management platform for SME manufacturers, already gaining traction.\n\nElectrix Vintage – Daniel Thomas: A sustainable second-hand fashion business.\n\nCalorie Dense Nutrition –: A high-protein health bar—free of harmful additives and surprisingly delicious!\n\nReef – Mark Schmidt: A platform for verifying content authenticity in an age of misinformation.\n\nThis event reminded me that I love working with students (former guidance counselor here ). These students aren’t just building businesses—they’re building the future. And when they’re ready to grow their teams, I’ll be there to support them.\n\nIf you had to pick one EO core value that resonates with you most, which would it be? Drop a comment! ",

        "content": " Why We Need Smart Meetings (Not Fewer) \nI’ve spent 13+ years designing workshops for companies like Google and Salesforce, and here’s what I’ve learned: The problem isn’t too many meetings—it’s poorly designed ones.\nMost meetings still rely on outdated tools (like chaotic whiteboards or rigid agendas) that kill creativity. That’s why we built, an AI-powered platform that helps teams run smarter meetings—focused on real-time engagement, strategic alignment, and outcomes that stick.\nIn my latest blog, I break down how blending creativity (“divergent thinking”) with structure can transform meetings from time-wasters into innovation engines. Spoiler: It’s not about cutting meetings. It’s about making them matter.\n Read it here: Why We Need Smart Meetings\n\nP.S. Follow me for more on facilitation, AI-driven collaboration, and leading teams that thrive in ambiguity.",

        "content": " DeepSeek's Disruption & Open-Source GenAI: A Critical Board Perspective\n\nThe recent DeepSeek breakthrough, combined with the broader rise of open-source GenAI, is reshaping the strategic landscape in ways that demand immediate board attention. As a director deeply engaged in tech governance, I'm seeing seismic shifts that boards must address:\n\nStrategic Inflection Points:\n1. DeepSeek has demonstrated that competitive AI performance is achievable without cutting-edge chips—challenging core assumptions about AI infrastructure investments\n2. Open-source GenAI models are enabling self-hosted solutions that address critical IP protection and data security concerns\n3. We're witnessing a democratization of AI innovation where smaller, specialized models achieve comparable results at fraction of the cost\n\nCritical Board Oversight Areas:\n\nRisk & Governance:\n• Export controls may not provide the technological moat previously assumed\n• Need for robust governance frameworks for open-source AI adoption\n• Clear compliance protocols for licensing and security measures\n• Infrastructure investment strategies need reassessment\n\nCompetitive Strategy:\n• Speed to market vs. security trade-offs\n• Developer experience and talent retention\n• Strategic partnerships vs. in-house development\n• Data sovereignty and IP protection\n\nThe $1 trillion market reaction to DeepSeek shows the stakes. But the real story isn't market volatility—it's about long-term value creation in an environment where technological advantages can shift rapidly.\n\nAction Items for Boards:\n1. Dedicate specific board time to examine AI governance frameworks\n2. Request comprehensive scenario planning from management\n3. Review risk frameworks to include emerging AI competitors\n4. Assess infrastructure investment strategies against new realities\n\nThe message is clear: This isn't just a tech trend—it's a strategic imperative that demands sophisticated board oversight. The companies that get this right will create sustainable competitive advantages; those that don't risk being left behind.\n\nWhat's your board's approach to balancing AI innovation with proper governance? How are you thinking about the implications of open-source AI for your competitive strategy?",
