Unlike OpenAI, DeepSeek offers open-source solutions for more customization, providing a cost-effective and energy-efficient alternative to Western AI giants.\n\nIts launch caused a notable decline in Nvidia’s stock price.\n\n— OpenAI, in collaboration with Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX, announced “The Stargate Project” to build an AI infrastructure system with the U.S. government.\n\n— Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta plans to invest $60-65 billion in AI initiatives in 2025.\n\nAs we can see, much investing is happening and DeepSeek’s success proved that innovation can break through, and I believe more startups will gain traction and adoption because of it.\n\nStartups aren’t just competing with giants anymore, they’re surpassing them…\n\nFor those of us building, this is our chance to create something truly valuable. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed with new AI projects launching daily, but real breakthroughs are still ahead—especially for Vacabee and the AI potential we’re unlocking.\n\nI’m grateful to be part of this space, pushing Web3 and AI forward with real innovation. But to succeed, we must build sustainably, with purpose—no shortcuts.\n\nThe future is being built now.",

Physical Rest\nYour body needs recovery to heal and restore energy.\n\n- Go to bed 30 minutes earlier each night.\n- Do gentle stretches or yoga before bed.\n\n2. Mental Rest\nYour mind needs breaks to stay clear and focused.\n\n- Take short breaks every hour to reset your mind.\n- Write down racing thoughts before bed.\n\n3. Emotional Rest\nBottled-up feelings drain your energy.\n\n- Set boundaries and say “no” when needed.\n- Talk openly with a trusted friend or therapist.\n\n4. Social Rest\nNot all social interactions are energising.\n\n- Spend time with people who uplift you.\n- Take a break from draining social interactions.\n\n5. Creative Rest\nYour mind needs inspiration to stay creative.\n\n- Take a walk in nature and observe your surroundings.\n- Listen to music that inspires you.\n\n6. Sensory Rest\nConstant noise and screens overwhelm your senses.\n\n- Turn off notifications for an hour each day.\n- Spend 10 minutes in silence before going to bed.\n\n7. Spiritual Rest\nYou need to feel connected to something bigger than yourself.\n\n- Spend a few minutes each day meditating or praying.\n- Reflect on your values and purpose through writing in a journal.\n\nBurnout isn’t always about doing too much.\n\nSometimes, it’s about not resting in the right way.\n\nWhich type of rest do you need most today?\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nIf you liked this post, you may like my newsletter: The Growth Mindset.\n\n\n\nRepost this to help your network & follow mefor more content like this.",

        "content": "Something big is happening on LinkedIn  \nhashtag\n#SocialSaturday \n\nIt’s not just about posting updates or connecting with colleagues anymore. The platform is changing fast. By 2025, LinkedIn won’t just be a place where professionals network; it’ll be a place where people come to watch, learn, and engage in a way we haven’t seen before.\n\nVideo is becoming the heartbeat of LinkedIn. Not just as another content format, but as a new way for people to consume information. It’s not about reading long posts and scrolling past static images anymore, LinkedIn wants you to stop, watch, and stay. Imagine a\nwhere you go, not just to check in, but to actually watch something valuable, just like you would on\nor\n. That’s where we’re headed.\n\nAnd it’s not just how we consume content, it’s how we create it, too. The time between having a great idea and getting it out into the world? It’s getting shorter. No more endless edits, no more second-guessing. The best content is the one that feels real, and LinkedIn is making space for more authenticity, more fast-moving ideas, and less over-polished fluff.\n\nNot all creators are the same.\nSome share insights based on their own expertise. Others stick to safe, templated content; infographics, carousels, things that “perform well.” But real impact? That comes from honest, experience-driven content, even if the engagement numbers fluctuate. That’s where trust is built. That’s where credibility grows.\n\nWe’re also seeing a shift in who gets to be the voice of a company. It’s no longer just about the CEO or founder. More and more, companies are looking within their teams, building multiple personal brands that work together, creating a bigger, more authentic voice across the platform. Because people trust people more than they trust companies.\n\nOne of the biggest changes?\nLinkedIn is moving away from polished, structured posts and towards something more human. Less robotic. Less corporate-sounding. More like a real person talking. And that means standing out isn’t about following trends, it’s about creating your own.\n\n? They’re not just a passing trend. They’re becoming key players in how companies connect with audiences. Businesses are realizing that tapping into creator communities isn’t just “marketing”; it’s building real relationships.\n\nAt the end of the day, LinkedIn in 2025 won’t be about chasing engagement. It’ll be about trust. About sharing what really matters. About solving problems instead of just performing well.\n\nAnd honestly? I’m here for it.\nI will add my brick to the LinkedIn legacy with, as it is a gateway to safe and secure networking  via LinkedIn! Yes!is integrated with LinkedIn, providing unique synergies between features for a better networking experience!\n\nIf you’ve noticed these shifts too, drop your thoughts below. Let’s talk about what’s coming.",

Jailbreaking is essentially the method to manipulate prompts in such a way that will persuade the LLM to generate 'unsafe' and 'harmful' content. So if we view this from a token generation POV, we can say that it is basically an optimization problem. Here, we essentially want to MAXIMIZE the probability of generating 'harmful' tokens based on the input prompts.\n\nSo, this is how the very definition of jailbreaking makes sense. We are essentially trying to manipulate our input prompts in such a way (setting up inputs) such that it WILL GENERATE Harmful content (probability of harmful token generation is maximised).\n\nHere is my full mathematical analysis of the jailbreaking concept and how it can be converted into an optimization problem.\n\nHope you find it bit insightful: ). I will share more mathematical concepts like this.",

In academia and in my frist startup, we were constrained by compute. When everyone went to the cloud, we created our own cloud, we cute massively from floats to integers when we could, we used hashtables, we would even use pointers where possible. This drastically reduced memory needs and cost.\n\nWe also used the 5% rule: if a result used less ressources but acheived the same result to 5% accuracy we would use the solution with drastically lower ressources.\n\n\n\n------\nImagine cutting-edge AI that doesn’t require massive data centers or a billion-dollar budget. That’s exactly what DeepSeek is delivering with its groundbreaking approach. Here's why this could be a major inflection point for AI development:\n\nUsing less memory:\n\nTraditional AI is like writing every number with 32 decimal places. DeepSeek was like used 8, still accurate enough with a whopping - 75% less memory needed.\n\n The Multi-Token System\nDeepSeek reads entire phrases instead of single words—making it 2x faster and nearly as accurate. When processing billions of words, this efficiency is a game-changer.\n Expert Systems at Work\nUnlike traditional models (where all parameters are always active), DeepSeek uses an expert system. Only the relevant \"experts\" wake up for the task at hand. This results in:\n 95% lower API costs\n Training cost down from $100M → $5M\n Hardware requirement: Just 2,000 GPUs instead of 100,000\n️ Open Source Transparency\nHere’s the twist: DeepSeek made it all open source! The code, technical papers, and methods are accessible to everyone, making it clear this isn’t magic—just brilliant engineering.\n Why This Matters\n1️⃣ AI development is now more accessible than ever.\n2️⃣ Big Tech's advantage? It’s shrinking.\n3️⃣ Nvidia’s hardware dominance could face serious disruption.\n The Takeaway\nDeepSeek’s innovative approach—building smarter, not bigger—may be the beginning of a new era in AI. This feels like the shift from mainframes to PCs or the rise of cloud computing.\n What do you think? Is this the future of AI? Let’s discuss the implications! ",

My friends and family thought I was crazy. While others had stability, I had a mattress on the floor, pot noodles for dinner, and a minimum-wage job.\n\nIt wasn’t glamorous. It wasn’t easy.\n\nBut doing something different - taking the risk - was the only way forward.\n\nEverything is a choice.\n\nSometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t.\n\nBut if you never take the leap, you’ll never know what you’re truly capable of.\n\nIf I hadn’t stepped onto that plane to Brussels in 1998, my life would look very different today. That risk, the struggles, the discomfort - those are what pushed me to the next level.\n\nWhat about you? Have you ever taken a risk that changed your life?\n\nOr is something still holding you back from making the move?\n\n Know someone on the edge of a big decision?\nSend this their way - sometimes, all we need is a little push.\n Image by @theopeninvite - because sometimes, a simple reminder is all we need.",
