Gather wins and contacts\n\n...do this immediately after finding out about a layoff, if you hear rumblings, or if your VP suddenly “leaves.” Restructuring is likely to follow.\n\n2. Start a networking plan\n\n…we love the 5-5-5 (see my about section for a link)\n\n3. Help someone else\n\n…it sets off a chain reaction in your brain that is empowering and mood-boosting — and builds goodwill that will be reciprocated 9 times out of 10\n\n4. Organize finances\n\n…what subs can you let go of for the time being to feel more “in control” of your life until checks start coming in again\n\n5. Get specific about your next step and WRITE IT DOWN\n\n…now gear all your strategy, moves, and networking around that goal.\n\n6. Do not wait out that severance\n\n…That 6-12 months will be up before you know it and you’ll be no closer to your goal by letting your recent results linger.\n\n7. Edify/Thank Others\n\n…now is the time to send TY notes, write your team testimonials, and reach out in good faith. It builds reciprocity and is linked to boosting your morale, mood, and productivity.\n\n\nBefore you do any “self-care”\nafter a layoff, stay in action\nso you don’t get stuck.\n\nXo\nClaire\n\n5X Layoff Survivor",

      "content": "A Ch!na-aligned APT group dubbed PlushDaemon has executed a supply-chain attack on IPany by embedding a sophisticated backdoor named SlowStepper into its installer.\n\nPlushDaemon is known for hijacking legitimate software updates and exploiting vulnerabilities in web servers to gain access. The IPany compromise \"represents a significant shift in its tactics\" marking its first observed supply-chain attack.\n\nThis has all the earmarks of a state-sponsored cyber-attack. Will update later this afternoon.",
