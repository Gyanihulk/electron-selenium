      "content": "From $2/day to getting acknowledged by Obama and Bill Gates:\n\nMy AI insights can propel your business from thriving to dominating in as little as 90 days!\n\nAttention: Visionary Entrepreneurs Or Savvy Business Leaders\n\nIf your business is generating $5M+ in annual revenue‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre still unsure if your company is truly prepared to take advantage of the AI revolution‚Ä¶\n\nThen this will be the most important message you‚Äôll read this month.\n\nThe harsh reality is that the business landscape is changing at the speed of light, and those who seize this moment will redefine the future (and get the lion‚Äôs share).\n\nHow do I know?\n\nHi, I‚Äôm Manuj Aggarwal, an AI pioneer whose work has been celebrated by luminaries like Barack Obama and Bill Gates.\n\nWith over 20 years of hands-on experience, 4 AI patents, and a proven track record of driving $500M+ in value for global giants like Microsoft, IBM, and T-Mobile, I specialize in turning bold ideas into transformative realities.\n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt always like that.\n\nMy journey began in a small Indian factory, slaving my bottom for $2 a day.\n\nToday, I share stages with world leaders, and I advise 8-, 9-, and even 10-figure companies.\n\nSome recent talks were at venues like the United Nations and Cornell University.\n\nIn other words, I don‚Äôt just understand innovation. I live and breathe it.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm offering something I haven‚Äôt ever done and will probably never do again.: a complimentary AI Readiness Assessment for your business.\n\nThis is a free but a POTENT deep dive into your business to uncover how AI can save you time, boost profits, and give you a competitive edge.\n\nImagine your business optimized with cutting-edge AI strategies,\n\n‚Ä¢ Driving growth of up to 40% within months\n‚Ä¢ Unprecedented efficiency reducing operational costs by up to 60%\n‚Ä¢ Unlocking hidden growth opportunities\n‚Ä¢ And positioning you as a market leader\n\nPicture having a tailor-made roadmap that reveals actionable insights you can implement immediately.\n\nAll while winning back an ENTIRE day every week and without paying a single dime upfront.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the catch, Manuj? Because there has to be a catch, right?‚Äù\n\nWell, I understand that the best form of marketing is word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nSo, I have a super simple request. If you find value in all the advice I‚Äôll provide to you to scale your business, I ask for one of these things in return:\n\n‚Ä¢ An introduction to another $5M+ ARR business that could benefit from my expertise.\n‚Ä¢ An invitation to speak on your podcast, at your event, or to your community.\n‚Ä¢ A mention of my name and podcast to your network, your list.\n\nAnd if you don‚Äôt find any value (which has never happened before), you don‚Äôt have to do anything.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to take advantage of this offer, here are the next steps:\n\n‚Ä¢ Verify my credentials - simply Google my name or review my LinkedIn profile\n‚Ä¢ Message me or comment below to secure your complimentary AI Readiness Assessment.\n\nAnd if you have any questions, drop them below.",

      "content": "A thought I've been having lately: yes \"AI is the great enabler\" we all agree. Everyone can do AI now, isn't that great! I actually think the gap between the top AI researchers has never been further from the average than now. I think 2025 will be a year of increased layoffs for data science teams that were comfortable doing data science the way we all did it before the agent revolution.\n\nTo survive as a future data scientist your programming skills will have to level up. Self-adaptive agents is not a strong suit of most data scientists, how many data scientists do you know that can say they are experts at genetic programming? How many are truly full stack? My experience has been very few. AutoML pipelines? Yes! Oh wait, an LLM does all of that now better than most of us ever did. As AI eats the market there will always be jobs for the top 10% in the AI talent pool, but the average will be on increasingly thin ice and the goal line to be in the top 10% will only accelerate ahead of all of us.\n\nData science is no longer the 'sexist job of the 21st century', now it is agentic/adaptive developers. They do in a week what everyone used to do in months and that amount of work is only accelerating. A year from now agentic programmers would expect to 10x their current pace which was already 10x their peers, the new 100x engineer coming online in 2025.",

Try it, and test the results.\n\nSuddenly, you'll see, in spectacular clarity, exactly what AI really is and what it is worth.

Their feedback not only improves your content but also helps you feel more prepared.\n\n Start with a relatable icebreaker\n\nShare a light personal anecdote or a simple question related to your topic. It relaxes both you and the audience - but don‚Äôt force humor if it doesn‚Äôt feel natural.\n\n Focus on one friendly face\n\nScan the room and find someone who looks kind or encouraging. Making eye contact with that person can help you feel like you‚Äôre having a conversation instead of addressing a crowd.\n\n Shift your perspective\n\nThe audience is made up of humans - just like you. They‚Äôre not there to judge you; they‚Äôre there to listen, learn, and connect.\n\n Breathe before you begin\n\nTake a few deep breaths to ground yourself. Slow breathing reduces anxiety and gives your voice more control.\n\n Keep it simple\n\nDon‚Äôt overcomplicate your message. Speak clearly, and if you forget something, keep going - most people won‚Äôt even notice.\n\nAnd above all, remind yourself:\nYou‚Äôre there to share something valuable, not to be perfect.\n\nAuthenticity resonates far more than flawless delivery.\n\nGood luck and if you‚Äôre in Berlin tomorrow would love to hear your pitch (see comments).\n\nWhat helps you to speak on stage?\n\n__________________________\n\nSharing my experience as an entrepreneur and angel investor.\n\nInvesting in early-stage B2B SaaS startups.\n\nFollow for more posts like this.",

I also need to have the courage to question my own thinking and encourage others to do the same.\n\nCandor: I need to be open, honest, and direct in my communication. Just as importantly, I expect the same level of honesty from others. I encourage those around me to provide feedback, even if it‚Äôs feedback I might not want to hear.\n\nCommitment: When I take on a new endeavor, I fully commit to it. I work hard and lead by example. However, I have a long history of failing personal commitments‚Äîsuch as health and fitness. I am working on that.\n\nCompetence: I strive to be an expert in my product and field. I pursue continuous learning, which has been ongoing as I have advanced through content management, product lifecycle management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and more.\n\nI imagine the Army has evolved leadership lessons over the past few decades.\n\nAnd I hope straightforward lessons like the 4 C‚Äôs are still taught.\n\nI found this old photo.

He was overly formal, tried out a slightly questionable accent, and even threw in phrases like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs circle back on this‚Äù (which he never said). His enthusiasm was palpable, but his laptop looked like it might overheat from the sheer intensity of the moment.\n\nAs his friends, we were dying from laughter on the sidelines. Someone whispered, ‚ÄúIs that Neeraj or James Bond?‚Äù Another joked his tie was so tight it might be cutting off his circulation.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the kicker: the client didn‚Äôt even notice the theatrics. They were too busy nodding along to the genuine ideas Neeraj shared later in the call.\n\n-----\nHere‚Äôs what this taught us:\n\nSometimes, in our quest to impress others‚Äîclients, colleagues, or even strangers‚Äîwe lose sight of what truly matters: authenticity. People connect with who you are, not who you‚Äôre pretending to be.\n\nSo here‚Äôs my question for you:\n- Have you ever gone overboard trying to impress someone at work?\n- What‚Äôs the most hilarious or awkward thing you‚Äôve seen someone do in a professional setting?\n\nDrop your stories in the comments below‚Äîlet‚Äôs share a laugh and remind each other that being real always wins!\n\nP.S.

But now? We‚Äôre flooded with applications, most of which aren‚Äôt relevant.‚Äù\n\nSorting through hundreds of resumes is time-consuming, and companies are realizing they don‚Äôt need more applicants‚Äîthey need the right candidate. That‚Äôs where we come in.\n\nWhen clients work with us, they‚Äôre not just getting resumes. They‚Äôre getting:\n\n A dedicated recruiter who knows their business inside and out.\n A carefully headhunted, pre-screened ideal candidate‚Äînot a stack of random applications.\n A streamlined hiring process that allows them to focus on growing their business instead of drowning in paperwork.\n\nThis shift is happening across industries. Companies that once relied on us only for executive hires are now handing us their mid- and entry-level roles because they trust our recruiters to deliver quality over quantity.\n\nAt, every recruiter works with specific clients, in specific industries, and in specific locations‚Äîbuilding relationships, understanding company culture, and ensuring each hire is the perfect fit.\n\nRecruiting isn‚Äôt just about finding candidates. It‚Äôs about finding the right one... ",
