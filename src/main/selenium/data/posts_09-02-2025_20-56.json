Review image 8, 9 and 10.\n\nIt's developed by'sin his book Revenue Architecture:\n\n[𝗦]ituation: Leads to pain ⤵️\n[𝗣]ain: Drives the necessity for change or impact ⤵️\n[𝗜]mpact: Is needed to adhere to a critical event ⤵️\n[𝗖]ritical [𝗘]vent: Determines decision making ⤵️\n[𝗗]ecision: Is based on Decision Criteria & Process used in ME𝗗𝗗IC\n\nWhy is it especially suitable for Enterprise selling? Because you're multi-threading. Talking to multiple stakeholders in your target account's buying committee.\n\nIdentifying their individual needs, critical events and decision criteria is essential for your ABM success.\n\n7 steps to use SPICED in ABM and Enterprise selling:\n\n1. Map it to Tier 1/2 ICPs to diagnose these segment's needs [image 1]\n2. Use SPICED to select target accounts [image 2]\n3. Map SPICED phases to your buying committee members [image 3]\n4. Drill down into the personas of your T1/2 buying committee and map SPICED to key roles [image 4 & 5]\n5. Incorporate the criteria in your discovery call playbooks [image 6]\n6. [Optional] Develop customer stories based on SPICED [image 6]\n7. Develop account plans based on SPICED [image 7, 8 & 9]\n\nTips/context:\n\n• Don't invent it all yourself. Especially step 4 is heavy on creation. Leverage AI. I used's and's custom GTM ChatGPT to help describe SPICED for personas. Link in 1st comment.\n• Start small. If the steps feel overwhelming start with mapping SPICED to ICP [image 2] and input that data into GTM GPT to develop SPICED for main personas [image 4]\n• Remember that every SPICED step you include is an incremental gain that will compound over time. If 6 months from you include 80% of this you'll increase your win rates no question.\n\nWould love to hear from my network how you leverage SPICED. What is the most practical application for people to start with?\n\nThe spreadsheet screenshots are part of my ABM worksheet. High-ACV B2B SaaS  come find me in DM or the comments for a copy",

        "content": "How I Automated My Calendar and Got 10-Hours of My Life Back Every Week...\n\n\"Your calendar isn’t just a schedule, it’s a silent killer of productivity...\"\n\nHere's how I got my time back...\n\nI used to live in my inbox, drowning in:\n- Back-and-forth emails to schedule meetings\n- Double-booked meetings that killed my focus\n- Endless admin work instead of high-impact selling\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThen, I found AI-powered calendar automation. It changed everything.\nHere’s how you can do the same and reclaim your time.\n\nStep 1: Get an AI Scheduling Assistant\n\nThe problem: Salespeople spend on average 6+ hours a week just scheduling meetings. That's wasted selling time.\n\nThe fix: Use an AI-powered scheduler like Reclaim, Motion, or Calendly.\n\nHere's what it does:\n Suggests available time slots automatically\n Syncs across time zones\n Reschedules meetings without your involvement\n\nPro Tip: Set “Priority blocks” for deep work so AI knows when not to book other tasks that are less important...\n\nStep 2: Let AI Handle Follow-Ups & No-Shows\n\nThe problem: 30% of sales calls get ghosted, and chasing people down eats up valuable time.\n\nThe fix: AI tools like Salesloft, Outreach, and Superhuman send:\n Automated reminders & rescheduling links\n Follow-ups with personalized messages\n Post-meeting summaries using AI-generated insights\n\nPro Tip: Train AI to recognize when a lead is hot or cold so it adjusts your follow-up cadence automatically.\n\nStep 3: Use AI to Optimize Your Day for Peak Performance\n\nThe problem: Most sales pros cram meetings into random slots, leading to burnout & context switching.\n\nThe fix: AI calendar tools analyze your peak productivity hours and:\n Batch calls into focus-friendly blocks\n Set aside deep work periods for strategy & prospecting\n Prevent overbooking so you stay sharp\n\nStep 4: AI-Generated Insights to Improve Future Meetings\n\nThe problem: Most sales teams make decisions based on gut feelings, not data. (Big Problem)\n\nThe fix: AI tools like Gong, Chorus, and Fireflies:\n\n Analyze meeting transcripts for objections & buying signals\n Suggest better ways to handle pricing discussions\n Identify patterns in successful vs. failed deals\n\n Pro Tip: Set up AI alerts for when prospects show high buying intent, so you never miss a closing opportunity...\n\nFinal Thoughts: What Happens When You Automate Your Calendar?\nAfter implementing this, my schedule stopped running me. I started running it and here's what happened:\n\n 10+ hours saved weekly\n More time spent selling, not scheduling\n Higher energy & focus on revenue-driving activities\n\nSales is about building relationships, not playing calendar Tetris.\n\nNow, tell me, how much time is your calendar stealing from you?\n---\n️ Share this post with a sales leader who needs to hear it.

        "content": "Reflecting on our participation in Hackathon 2025 \"INNOVERSE' 36\", hosted by Atal Community Innovation Center-SGT University and SGT UNIVERSITY . However, we humbly acknowledge that we did not secure the position this time. However, we view this outcome as a stepping stone towards growth and improvement.\n\nMy first hackathon with my team(,,,) was an absolute whirlwind of an experience. From the initial brainstorming sessions, fueled by copious amounts of caffeine and snacks, to the late-night coding sprints, the energy was infectious. We faced our fair share of challenges, from debugging nightmares to moments where we thought our project was doomed, but we tackled each obstacle together. The camaraderie and support within the team were incredible; everyone brought their unique skills to the table, and we learned so much from each other along the way. While sleep was a distant memory and the pressure was on, the thrill of creating something from scratch in such a short timeframe was exhilarating. Seeing our project come to life, even in its prototype form, was incredibly rewarding, and the sense of accomplishment we shared as a team made all the late nights and frantic coding totally worth it.

        "content": "Comprehensive GCC Legal & Regulatory Updates \n\nHere’s a detailed overview of recent impactful developments across the region:\n\n1. Bahrain: A groundbreaking legislative proposal aims to impose stricter penalties for privacy violations, including imprisonment and hefty fines. This move seeks to deter unauthorized invasions of personal privacy, underlining Bahrain's commitment to safeguarding individual rights.\n\n\n2. UAE: Artificial Intelligence is making its way into the judiciary system. Trials are underway to leverage AI for case analysis, focusing on clear-cut cases requiring no human discretion. Beyond rulings, AI is streamlining legal processes by translating, summarizing, and analyzing massive volumes of documents—making legal systems faster and more efficient.\n\n\n3. Sharjah: A new HR law for military personnel introduces changes to promotions and retirements, along with the creation of a Police Judiciary Council. Key updates include:\n\n- Regulatory committees will oversee promotions and retirements to ensure criteria are met.\n- Higher-rank promotions/retirements require Ruler approval; lower ranks handled internally.\n- The Police Judiciary Council will review violations and impose penalties, subject to final ratification.\n\n\n4. Oman: The State Council and Majlis Al Shura have approved draft personal income tax laws with adjustments. Key highlights:\n\n- A tax exemption limit raised to RO 50,000 to support the middle class.\n- Gratuity and end-of-service benefits excluded from taxable income.\n- Salaries above RO 2,500/month will be taxed, impacting around 32,000 individuals based on prior studies.\n\n\n5. Qatar: The Ministry of Justice has unveiled cutting-edge digital services for real estate. The updated Sak Application now facilitates issuing replacement deeds, correcting property details, and managing mortgages. With QR codes integrated into deeds, property information is easily accessible via GIS and Google Maps. Plus, documents are delivered via Qatar Post, eliminating the need for in-person visits.\n\n\n6. Saudi Arabia: The Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) has extended its fines and penalties waiver initiative until 30 June 2025. Key benefits include:\n\n- Waivers on late registrations, payment delays, and non-compliance with VAT e-invoicing.\n- Instalment plans available for settling outstanding debts.\n- Exclusions apply to tax evasion penalties and fines settled before the initiative.",

Rules are reflections of collective morality, shaped by time and context. Beliefs are filters, often clouded by personal experience and cultural conditioning. Both can guide or mislead, but neither is an absolute compass.\n\nThe real measure of good and evil lies in the choices we make with awareness. Every choice vibrates with energy—some expand our consciousness toward compassion and harmony, while others contract it toward fear and separation. The Bhagavad Gita speaks of actions rooted in dharma (righteousness), not for personal gain but for the greater flow of life, as paths toward true goodness.\n\nGood arises when choices align with love and unity; evil appears when choices fuel disconnection and suffering. Both forces are within us—testing and evolving our soul’s journey. Spiritual growth is about discerning these energies and choosing, again and again, what brings us closer to our divine nature.\n\nIn the end, it’s the heart’s whisper, not the world’s judgment, that defines what is truly good.",
