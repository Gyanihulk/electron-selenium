      "content": "Where Are Digital Transformation Dollars Going?\n\nDeloitte's latest article breaks down where organizations are focusing their digital transformation budgets, and it's eye-opening. Investments are leaning heavily into areas like data analytics, cloud infrastructure, and customer experience—technologies that don't just sound impressive but actually improve agility and business outcomes.\n\nWhat stood out to me? Companies are moving beyond chasing the latest tools. They're aligning spending with clear, measurable goals. It's a shift from \"let's adopt the newest tech\" to \"how does this directly drive long-term value?\"\n\nAs budgets grow, leaders face a challenge: making sure every dollar delivers real impact.\n\nHow is your organization tackling this? Are your tech investments moving the needle in meaningful ways?\n\nRead more on Deloitte:",

      "content": "5-18 yrs old: Bus boy, dishwasher, cook, server, etc. at my parent's restaurant\n\n18: My parents sold the rest. and I got a job selling speedos for $7.50/hr\n\n19: Sold speedos and was an asst. swim coach\n\n20: Sales intern selling insurance making $9/hr\n\n21: Promoted to sales associate earning $9.50/hr\n\n22: First B2B sales job. Almost fired after 60 days\n\n23: Hit **#1** 9 months in a row and promoted 2X\n\n24: Recession in full swing, the branch was consolidated. Demoted despite results. Decided to get my MBA at night\n\n25: With a chip on my shoulder… destroyed numbers and got promoted 2X\n\n26: MBA done. Decided to quit my job, take 2 steps back, and switch to a new company. In the first 6 months, my sales manager, directors and VP quit. I almost quit too but decided to keep going.\n\n27: Became one of the top reps and promoted in 9 months to lead the team.\n\n28: Turned the underperforming team into a perennial President's Club winning team.\n\n29: Grew the team from 6 to 22 while maintaining the track record.\n\n30: Promoted to director in 4.5 years in the Fortune 500 org with 85 employees. Scared and nervous if I could perform at this scale.\n\n31: Hit Club first year as a director and decided to start a side hustle teaching others what I had done for 9 consecutive years.\n\n32: Record-breaking results and lateral promotion to a training director over 230.\n\n33: Internal company org shifts and back in the market director role. I'm disappointed but relieved at the same time. Grew the org to 110, kept breaking records, and stacking cash+equity.\n\n35: After another Club year, decided to retire from corporate to go all in on my side hustle.\n\n36: It's a rough year 1 and I wanted to quit daily. Ended up hitting 7-figures with the biz and was recognized as a LinkedIn Top Voice. Also ended up getting featured in Forbes, Yahoo! Finance, and more.\n\n37: Started getting burnt out. Thought about quitting and then realized I needed to hire a team. Built a small team. The biz grew more.\n\n38: With the extra capacity, wrote a book in 3 months and it became a WSJ Best Seller. Biz kept growing \n\n39: Made some bad hires and went backward in profitability for the first time. (My fault-should have vetted them more.) Questioned myself and wondered if I wanted to keep doing this.\n\n40: This year. We're building something truly great. Our system gets some of the best and fastest results in the sales coaching industry. We're also building behind-the-scenes AI coaching products the world has never seen. Excited and optimistic for the future. The best is yet to come.\n\nTo all those fighting their own battles, we're all in the middle of writing our own stories.\n\nThe worse demons we face, the more epic the story.\n\nYou either get an inspiring outcome or an inspiring story.\n\nEither way? You WIN.\n\nSo keep getting after it.\n\nThe only way you lose is if you QUIT.\n\nMay your internal desires be far greater than your obstacles.\n\nRepost this to help inspire more people to keep going ️",
