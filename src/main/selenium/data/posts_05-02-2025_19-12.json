        "content": "Worst compensation plan ever or systemic theft? You tell me.\n\nHere is another submission for one of the worst compensation plans ever. This one by one of the big 3 cell phone providers in the states.\n\nYou have a monthly quota. You don’t get paid any commission if you are not over 40% of quota for the month. Zero. Nada. If you hit 40% or more, you get paid on the 40% retroactively.\n\nHowever, if you don’t hit your full quota for the quarter, the shortfall gets carried forward as a negative balance to be offset by earned commissions the following quarter. They make you pay them for not hitting their inflated unachievable target.\n\nThey take your earned compensation from you the following quarter for not hitting their targets the prior quarter. It's just unreal. You were never paid compensation on the missed target but are having compensation taken away for missing it. It just insane.\n\nAs you can imagine, there are salespeople that have not been paid commission in 6 or 9 months but have had hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales.\n\nThis is a Fortune 500 multi billion dollar publicly traded company doing this to reps without big six figure base salaries. Most of these folks are 20-somethings with very little experience or knowledge of what is allowed or not.\n\nI can’t imagine how this could possibly be legal. I know it is not moral or ethical or fair or reasonable. It appears to be systemic theft by the employer on unknowing employees.\n\nI suggested that she reach out to the attorney general’s office, the department of labor, escalate to the c-suite, and document everything.\n\nAs far as a lawyer goes, unless they make it a class action, there isn’t one that is going to go after a multi-billion-dollar company over tens of thousands of dollars in stolen commissions.\n\nJust gross. You can’t have compensation taken away for compensation you never earned. Just so wrong.",

You’re just moving up the spiral.\n\nBut sometimes it’s hard to see the progress.\n\nHere’s what you can do when the journey feels unclear:\n\n1. Appreciate unseen efforts\n\nNot every milestone is visible. Working on your mindset, building relationships, and gaining emotional resilience aren’t things you can measure on a scoreboard - but they matter just as much.\n\n2. Reframe setbacks as opportunities\n\nIt’s easy to feel like you’re running in circles when things go off track. But every loop gives you a chance to apply what you’ve learned and try again with new insights.\n\n3. Celebrate small wins\n\nEven when things seem repetitive, take a moment to recognize how far you’ve come. Small wins and daily actions compound into big results over time.\n\n4. Trust your unique path\n\nYour spiral won’t look like anyone else’s. Some loops might feel long, others short. The only comparison worth making is with your past self.\n\n5. Stay patient through the process\n\nGrowth isn’t instant. Keep showing up, keep putting in the effort, and keep trusting that each loop is bringing you closer to your goals.\n\nProgress isn’t about how it looks to others.\n\nSo, if you feel like you’re running in circles, don’t stress.\n\nYou’re not back at square one - you’re leveling up with every turn.\n\nImage credit: Mounika Studio (Instagram) ",

Add 1 trillion trade deficits a year to that. Not counting DEBT at state levels. \n\nBasically because of bad policies we are giving our kids a hell of a financial liability. I hope all American patriots can put aside their party preference and think about future of our kids.\n\nA white friend asked me recently why Indians are conservatives ? I told him - it’s a common sense taught by our parents “One should live within their means”. Are we ?\n\nAlso, I’m sure you know this that Americans are adding around $1.24 trillion personal credit card debt at around 30% APR. can you imagine how this will turn out.\n\nall social things aside you need to understand that once this bubble blows up for our kids there will be no DEI nor any social programs and things will be REALLY BAD. So people like me just want a way for our law makers to be more accountable and we are hoping TRUMP can do it.\n\nHappy to hear your side on above. And a plan that a layman can understand. Pls remember half the country has voted for Trump because of above reasons and more such reasons. All common sense.",

One day, engineering is haunted by scattered spreadsheets, disconnected systems, and the ghost of legacy processes past. The next? It’s as if a full-blown exorcism has been performed.\n\nSuddenly, the chaos is gone (mostly). Engineering can actually find the latest design data. Quality and supply chain feel the ripple effect of newfound organization. And when it finally makes its way to manufacturing? Well, let’s just say there are fewer screams—at least the terrifying kind.\n\nPLM transformations aren’t easy, but when done right, they change everything. If you’ve been through one, you know the mix of relief, celebration, and maybe just a little bit of post-go-live PTSD. But in the end? Totally worth it.\n\nTo all the teams out there making it happen—keep fighting the good fight. And if you need an extra hand (or an exorcist), you know where to find me.",

Some decisions that are a long term good may affect one's mental health negatively in the short term, like by being highly stressful decisions, for instance. In fact, the research shows that folks with a long term orientation have better life satisfaction outcomes overall (on average). It may also be worth mentioning that life satisfaction and fleeting happiness are two different things. People with kids report lower moment to moment happiness than people without kids, but report higher life satisfaction overall (long term).",

        "content": "Baby pikas, called pups, are small, fluffy mammals that live in rocky, mountainous regions. Well-camouflaged with their brownish-gray fur, they are expertly suited to their alpine homes.\n\nWhat's fascinating is that baby pikas remain in underground burrows for the first couple of weeks after birth. This way, they stay protected from predators and the extreme weather conditions in their harsh habitats.\n\nDuring this secluded period, their vulnerable bodies begin to grow stronger, preparing them for the challenges of mountain life. After about two to four weeks, they venture out, joining their parents on foraging trips. This gradual exposure is crucial, as it allows them to learn essential survival skills from their parents while gradually adapting to the outside world.\n\nWhile adult pikas are known for their sharp, high-pitched “eep!” calls used for communication and warning of danger, pups produce softer squeaks. These sounds help them stay connected to their mothers and siblings, ensuring their safety in the wild.\n\nThough tiny, their vocalizations are an essential part of their survival.\n\nWater is an important resource for them as they maintain their burrows, and survive in their mountain habitats. Future generations of baby pikas depend on the access to ample and clean water to thrive.\n\nIf we invest in clean water supply systems, protect watersheds, and educate communities about water conservation, we can ensure a sustainable water future for all species.\n\nAnimals will thrive and flourish alongside us as stewards of the environment.",

When you're posting without a clear value, you're just adding noise.\n\n Engage Consistently - Don’t just post and forget. Engage with your network. Respond to comments, share relevant insights, and build relationships. Engagement is key to building trust and attracting inbound leads.\n\n Focus on Storytelling - People connect with stories, not just facts. Share your journey, struggles, and wins. Make your content relatable.\n\n Use Clear Calls to Action - Don’t leave people guessing. Always add a call to action that directs your audience to take the next step - whether it’s DMing you or visiting your website.\n\n Use the Power of Content Variety-  Mix it up! Use videos, polls, carousels, and even documents to keep your content fresh and engaging.\n\nStill not seeing results?\n\nIf you’re a coach, founder, or CXO looking to build a personal brand that works for you 24X7, DM me.\n\nLet’s make sure your content attracts the leads you deserve!",

Yes, there will be challenges and tough moments, but if you stay determined, you’ll find the strength to keep moving forward.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n Know Yourself: Take the time to discover your values, strengths, weaknesses, passions and dreams. The more you understand yourself, the clearer your path becomes. With this knowledge, you can focus on what matters and let go of distractions.\n\n Create Your Roadmap: While many chase external goals like money or success, what we're truly seeking is identity. Once you define who you want to be, set specific, measurable and achievable goals. Let inspiration, not obligation, drive your actions. Own your journey, take responsibility and move forward with purpose.\n\n‍️ Take Action: Life may feel short, but every step you take matters. Progress is made with consistent action, even if it's just a small step each day. Aim to be a better version of yourself today than you were yesterday. Small steps lead to big change.\n\n⏳ Stay Committed: Transformation doesn’t happen overnight. It requires patience, resilience, and a willingness to keep going, even when it feels tough. As Naval Ravikant wisely said, \"Grind and sweat, toil and bleed, face the abyss. It's all part of becoming an overnight success.\"\n\nEvery choice you make and every action you take is crafting your future. Your journey to becoming the best version of yourself is something truly beautiful to witness.\n\nWe are all on this path and I believe each of our futures are full of possibility and greatness.",

While India was going digital, I saw an opportunity: personalized wedding websites.\n\nTo help the business grow, I taught myself SEO. I wanted better visibility, better clients, and, most importantly, a steady income.\n\nThese one-page websites, with photos, music, and personal messages, became our niche. While it wasn’t a fortune (we earned ₹20-30k), it was enough to show me the potential of entrepreneurship.\n\nIt also taught me the importance of finding small wins and turning them into opportunities.\n\nEventually, I had to make the tough decision to shut the company down. It wasn’t easy, but it cemented one thing for me: I was meant to be an entrepreneur.\n\nHere are the lessons that the first venture taught me:\n\n1. Every setback is a setup for success: Failure is just part of the process. It’s where real growth happens.\n\n2. The power of a side hustle: My side hustle often outperformed my monthly salary. That extra effort is what fuels breakthroughs.\n\n3. Keep learning: I didn’t know SEO, but I learned it because the business needed it. Skills compound over time.\n\nThat first company didn’t succeed, but it taught me everything I needed to know.\n\nResilience, risk-taking, and finding unconventional opportunities.\n\nToday, as I look back, I know that shutting down that venture was the first step toward building something bigger.\n\nIt’s a reminder that the road to success isn’t linear.\n\nWhat did your first venture teach you? Let me know in the comments.",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

It’s not a flashy industry. It’s not the kind of thing that makes headlines or gets most people scrolling with excitement.\n\nBut you know what is interesting?\n\nThe CEO’s story.\n\nSo that’s what we leaned into.\n\nWe told their story, not with corporate jargon or fluff, but with honesty and humanity.\n\nNow let’s hear the results.\n\nTheir first post with us went viral in week one.\n\nHalf a million impressions in 4 months after having a dead profile for years.\n\nTheir DMs exploded. Clients from the past reached out for more business. Media press texted them for features. Found some of their most valuable recent hires from LinkedIn.\n\nBecause here’s the thing to pay attention to: People don’t care about your company, they care about you.\n\n‘Humanizing’ is the difference between being ignored and being remembered.\n\nYour struggles, your wins, your story - that’s what makes people stop and pay attention.\n\nIf your LinkedIn content isn’t doing that, it’s not working.

If you’re constantly running on caffeine, stress, and “just one more task,” you’re not being productive—you’re being exploited (sometimes by your own habits).\n\nSo, how do you stay sane in a game where everyone’s playing 4D chess?\n\n1. Take Refresh Breaks Like a Boss – No, doomscrolling emails doesn’t count. Step away, take a walk, stretch, breathe. Your brain needs space to function.\n\n2. Know When to Exit the Chat – Not every debate or office drama needs your energy. Silence is a power move.\n\n3. Set Boundaries and Mean It – If you’re always available, people will expect you to be. Respect your own time first.\n\n4. Find Your ‘Non-Work’ People at Work – A quick rant, a shared meme, or a coffee break with someone who gets it can be the ultimate reset.\n\n5. Detach Your Worth from Your Work – You’re not just your KPIs. You’re a person first, an employee second.\n\nMental health isn’t a luxury—it’s fuel for sustainable success. Take care of it like you would your paycheck. After all, no promotion is worth losing yourself.",

        "content": "\"No, Malkie. No thank you.\"\nThat's what my client, a talented senior executive, said when her unconscious revealed the key to her leadership dilemma. It was way out of her comfort zone, and she came back at me with pure resistance.\n\nIn return she got the big grin my clients know so well. The grin that means, I can see what’s coming. Buckle in!\n\nHere’s the backstory. She was stuck in a power struggle with one employee who seemed immune to her usual mix of logic, authority, and direct communication. Everything she normally did was proving useless, and my client was getting more and more frustrated.\n\nDuring our session, as we ventured beyond the visible realm of leadership tactics, her unconscious mind directed us to something unexpected: her inner Trickster.\n\n\"I don't do sneaky,\" she insisted, her voice carrying the weight of years of structured leadership. \"I lead with integrity.\"\n\nAnd she does. But integrity can have a good time, too.\n\nThis is where transformation begins. She needed to rethink how she understood the Trickster. Trickster energy is about deception, but only in its Shadow. In the light it's about joyous disruption. It's the art of turning walls into doors, transforming rigid patterns into playful possibilities.\n\nOnce she saw that, she was brave enough to create a relationship with her inner Trickster. It told her that Instead of pushing harder, she can change the pattern. She learned to meet resistance with curiosity instead of frustration. And it showed her when and how to use humor and a light touch where before she’d used authority.\n\nThe results were amazing to both of us. A months long battle dissolved in days.\n\nSometimes the most powerful change doesn't come from pushing harder, it comes from changing the game entirely. Like turning lead into gold, it's about seeing the potential in what we've been resisting.\n\n What if your next breakthrough is hiding in an archetype you've been avoiding? Tell me what you think below. Your insights inspire others!",

You will work more than you rest.\n3. You will miss important moments.\n\nThe idea of perfect balance is a myth.\nYou need to adjust your expectations ASAP:\n\n- One day, your family might need you more than work.\n- One day your business might need you more.\n- One day you might need yourself more.\n\nYou've got to prioritise what's important in the moment.\n\nLearning to recognise when you need each moment is how you make progress. Building a business requires sacrifice and a lot of it. It's what you signed up for.\n\nBut it’s up to you to manage those sacrifices, make conscious decisions, and accept that you won’t always get it right because balance doesn't exist.\n\nThis is the reality of startup life.",
