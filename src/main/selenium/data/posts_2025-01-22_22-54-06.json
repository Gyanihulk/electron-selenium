Whereas PIP ( from what I have read & heard) is written by the manager concerned & also assessed & concluded by himself!! That can't be fair..In other countries, if the employee is unjustly dismissed, he /she can be compensated usually with 24 months back pay plus reinstatement. Further the employment lawyer there who acts for employees only is not allowed ( at least morally or professionally ) to act for the Employer even in other unrelated cases or different Employers.

      "content": "I‚Äôve spent the past few days on calls and emails, helping leaders, HR professionals, and DEI practitioners figure out how to meet this moment without burning out.  It‚Äôs not uncharted territory‚Äîwe‚Äôve weathered years of upheaval, learning to adapt, keep things moving, and care for our teams. But it‚Äôs still hard, and it helps to remember that you don‚Äôt have to do it alone.\n\nNavigating this moment can feel like walking a tightrope. The issues demanding our attention seem endless. On the one hand, we‚Äôre expected to stay neutral, steering clear of politics at work, and on the other, staying silent when team members feel the real impacts of decisions can feel like letting them down.\n\nIn moments like these, lean on the beautiful basics:\n\n Be a steady presence. You don‚Äôt need to have all the answers‚Äîno one does right now. What matters most is showing up for your team with care and consistency. Build trust and show them you‚Äôll figure out whatever comes next together.\n\n Lean into your workplace rhythms. Every team member should know that a safe work environment is a priority‚Äîa place where they can turn, be heard, and find support‚Äîwhile respecting that some may choose to opt-out. If statements are your thing, go for it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a big production. Use meetings, check-ins, or 1:1s as intentional moments to listen and connect. A simple \"How can I support you?\" or a thoughtful note can go a long way.\n\n Be clear about safety and well-being. Let your team know it‚Äôs OK (and encouraged) to step away, recharge, and care for themselves or their families. Be equally clear that harm to co-workers won‚Äôt be tolerated. Revisit your shared values and code of conduct (or create one if missing). If formal benefits aren‚Äôt available, small gestures‚Äîlike gift cards, mindfulness breaks, or a fun playlist‚Äîcan boost energy and lift spirits for those feeling worried, disengaged or burned out.\n\n Don‚Äôt forget about you. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup‚Äù is a saying for a reason. Set boundaries, ask for support, and prioritize your well-being. You‚Äôre modeling what care and balance look like for your team.\n\nIf your organization‚Äôs values and principles feel unclear, let this be your signal to take stock.\n\nYour team is paying attention. Show up with confidence, heart, and a steady presence. You‚Äôre not just navigating a moment; you‚Äôre shaping the conditions for your team to thrive. That‚Äôs powerful, meaningful work‚Äîand it starts with you.\n\nHow are you showing up for your teams right now?",

      "content": "\"Wow, I knew it would work, but seeing the results still blew my mind!\"- One of my clients said recently after putting my advice into action for her business.\n\nHonestly, the recommendation seemed like a no-brainer to me‚ÄîI've spent years helping solopreneurs grow their businesses, so I know exactly what works. But seeing it all click for my client? That never gets old.\n\nI spend a lot of time thinking about challenges like this, and the solutions I offer are ones I know will make a difference. What might seem basic to me can often be a game-changer for someone else who's still figuring things out.\n\nAnd I bet you have some of those insights in your work too. What seems like second nature to you could be exactly what someone else needs to move their business forward.\n\nMy advice: Don‚Äôt hold back! Speak up and share your expertise. You never know when something you think is ‚Äúsimple‚Äù could be the breakthrough someone else needs.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the best \"basic\" piece of advice you've shared that truly made an impact?",
