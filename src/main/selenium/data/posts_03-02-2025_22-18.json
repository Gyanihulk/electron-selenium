Lack of preparation:\n\nIf you don't do your research on the prospect and their business before the meeting, you won't be able to ask relevant questions or provide valuable insights. This can make the prospect feel like you don't understand their needs and can damage the relationship.\n\n2. Poor communication:\n\nIf you don't set clear goals for the meeting or communicate them effectively to the prospect upfront, you may end up talking past each other or not covering important topics. Frame the meeting before starting so they know the focus is on discovery, rather than showing them your product or service.\n\n3. Asking the wrong questions:\n\nIf you ask closed-ended questions that don't encourage the prospect to share more information, you may not get a clear understanding of their needs or challenges.\n\n4. Not listening actively:\n\nIf you're not actively listening to the prospect during the meeting, you may miss important details or opportunities to build rapport.\n\n5. Focusing too much on selling:\n\nIf you're too focused on selling your product or service during the meeting, you may come across as pushy or not interested in the prospect's needs. This can damage the relationship and make it harder to close the deal later on.\n\nIf you want help building stronger relationships with your prospects, avoid these common pitfalls and set yourself up for success.",

Instead of celebrating how many jobs a company can create, we’re measuring success by how many jobs can be eliminated with AI. Not long ago, we admired businesses for their ability to provide work, especially in regions facing hardship. Now, we risk losing sight of the human impact of hiring.\n\nA thriving business isn’t just about efficiency. It’s about building with purpose, uplifting communities, and empowering human potential. Global hiring isn’t just good for business. It’s an opportunity to create real change in people’s lives.\n\nThe best companies aren’t just those that scale fast, but those that build sustainably, inclusively, and with a mission that extends beyond themselves.\n\nLet’s embrace the power of human capital across the globe. Let’s build products that matter, create opportunities that transform lives, and lead with a mindset that looks beyond borders. ",

When they are going through life cycle events in their personal life. When personal tragedies happen.\n\nWhen the employer no longer views the employee as valuable, or as effective, or reliable or focused as they were before.\n\nI’ve have spoken to employees who were terminated\n before a wedding/honeymoon\n during/after a divorce\n before, during, and after parental leave\n after putting down a deposit on a house\n after breaking ground building a new home\n after disclosing an illness or medical condition\n while taking time off to care for a dying parent in hospice\n while recovering from complications associated with an organ transplant\n while recovering from the emotional trauma of a sexual assault\n while being a remote working having to relocate for medical care for a dying child or spouse\n and so many more that are just as bad if not worse.\n\nI consulted with a kind and selfless manager who notified his employer that his wife had Parkinson’s disease.\n\nHe shared that he might be distracted over the coming months and may have to take some intermittent FMLA to support his wife.\n\nDespite working for the employer for more than 7 years, he was terminated within 2 months of the notification.\n\nThis is not an outlier. This is what happens in the dark, much more often than we could ever imagine while the loyal employee is scarred and damaged for a lifetime by the actions of their employer.\n\nOnly share when you must. When it will benefit you to do so. When your job is at stake if you don’t.\n\nOtherwise share as little as possible with your leadership about the important things in your life. They just might use if against you. They are not your family or friends.",

Perhaps a \"problem statement\" and call out that once they get settled it would be great to meet because of XYZ -- you can also send them a coffee and say \"as you ramp up, enjoy a few morning coffees on me as you watch those onboarding videos!\"\n\nBONUS: Filter by \"past customer\" or \"past company = customer list\"\n\nThis will give you previous users / customers of your product.\n\nThat is all.\n\nWant more Natoli's Nuggets like this?

But humans resist change. Learning something new feels overwhelming—until it doesn’t.\n\n, CEO of, breaks it down:\n\n1️⃣ Simplify the learning curve – The easier it is to start, the faster adoption happens.\n\n2️⃣ Support beats self-service – Even a simple platform needs guidance. Hands-on support ensures users don’t get stuck.\n\n3️⃣ Meet customers where they are – Some teams have 300+ users. Training needs to be scalable, structured, and ongoing.\n\nAdoption isn’t just about features. It’s about making sure people actually use them.\n\nThat’s how you turn software into a habit—and a habit into success.\n\n Watch the full conversation with Dharmendra Singh here:",

I learned that leadership isn’t about titles—it’s about actions.\n\nAnyone can lead. Anyone can create impact.\n\nHere are 10 behaviors that make you look like a follower, not a leader (and how to fix them):\n\n1️⃣ Always waiting for permission\n↳ Followers wait to be told what to do. Leaders take initiative.\n↳ Identify problems and propose solutions without being asked.\n\n2️⃣ Avoiding tough conversations\n↳ Dodging conflict makes you seem passive.\n↳ Prepare for difficult conversations by writing down the facts and key points.\n\n3️⃣ Never offering new ideas\n↳ Staying silent in meetings makes people think you are disengaged.\n↳ Prepare 1-2 ideas before every meeting, even if small.\n\n4️⃣ Over-apologizing\n↳ Constantly saying “sorry” makes you seem insecure.\n↳ Reflect on whether an apology is really necessary before saying it.\n\n5️⃣ Over-explaining your decisions\n↳ Justifying everything makes you seem unsure.\n↳ State your decision clearly, then stop: “I believe this is the best approach because…”\n\n6️⃣ Being too agreeable\n↳ Saying “yes” to everything shows a lack of critical thinking.\n↳ Politely challenge ideas with phrases like, “Have we considered this angle instead?”\n\n7️⃣ Relying too much on your manager\n↳ Always leaning on your boss signals you can’t operate independently.\n↳ Before asking for help, outline 2-3 possible solutions to the problem.\n\n8️⃣ Avoiding visibility\n↳ Hiding behind your work makes you forgettable.\n↳ Volunteer for stretch projects that challenge and highlight your skills.\n\n9️⃣ Deflecting credit\n↳ Downplaying your contributions makes you look unsure about your value.\n↳ Acknowledge the team while owning your role: “It was a great team effort, and I led X.”\n\n Complaining without solutions\n↳ Venting about problems without action makes you seem powerless.\n↳ Pair every complaint with at least one solution.\n\nIf you want to be seen as a leader, start showing up as one.\n\nWhich one of these behaviors surprised you the most? Do you have any to add? Let me know in the comments!\n\nP.S. If you want in-depth personal and career growth advice, sign up for my coaching style newsletter!

        "content": "Meetings aren’t work\n\nWork is when you turn your brain on, think critically and solve problems\n\nHere is what I do to cut down on meetings and get more of what matters done\n\n1. Asynchronous video updates - don’t schedule a meeting to get feedback on a deck, send a video talking through it. People can watch at 1.25 speed and get better feedback faster\n\n2. Get ruthless about adding priorities. When we talk in leadership about something being a new priority the question is “should this wait until next quarter with everything going?” The answer usually is yes\n\nMore priorities = more meetings\n\nMake sure your team has at least one slightly annoying, in a good way, person  who isn’t an internal optimist. You need people to ground the conversation is positive but constructive way. This person helps to poke holes in why it may not be priority so you don’t have to have more meetings on it.\n\n3. Delegate - I loves book Buy Back Your Time. He has a saying “80% done by someone else is 100% *bleeping* awesome”.\n\nYou probably can delegate a meeting here or there that will empower someone else\n\nLook at your week? Find at least 8-10 hours to do some real work and see how rewarding work can actually be ",
