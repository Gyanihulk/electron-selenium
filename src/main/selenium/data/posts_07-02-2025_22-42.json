        "content": "Last year, I spoke to the CRO of a $120M ARR SaaS who KILLED their Sales Enablement tech budget and moved back to Google Drive. Here's what went wrong (and why he called SE a \"big lie\"):\n\n\nCONVO RECAP:\n\nCRO: The entire concept of Sales Enablement is a big lie.\n\nMe: Ok, you got my attention‚Ä¶ elaborate?\n\nCRO: Look at the tools and the ways people fill this role. I need my AEs to multithread, run better calls, build champions better, etc. But we‚Äôre paying [Top 3 enablement vendor] for soooo many bells and whistles, and what we end up with is basically a glorified Google Drive.\n\nMe: What do you think went wrong?\n\nCRO: These tools are solving for the wrong problem. Content Management isn't Enablement. It is a marketing/sales alignment problem, not a sales effectiveness one. Too many of the Enablement folks out there are really more L&D experts or marketers than sales experts, so the enablement tech giants focus on them.\n\nMe: So, what is Sales Enablement in your mind?\n\nCRO: Solving for better deal execution, a better workflow with our buyers, and insights about deals (not just how content is being used). And sales experts should run this. Our team ends up downloading and emailing content to clients, ignoring the tech. I don't need to pay $70,000 for what is essentially GDrive.\n\n\nMY THOUGHTS:\n\nThat might sound harsh, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîhe‚Äôs not wrong.\n\nWe‚Äôre not enabling Sales if we‚Äôre not improving the Buyer-Facing Process.\n\nWe‚Äôre not enabling Sales if we‚Äôre not enabling Buyers.\n\nYears of ‚ÄòGrowth At All Costs‚Äô made us lose sight of what matters.\n\nSales Enablement should NOT be about:\n\n- how well the enabler knows how to train people\n- how many case studies and ebooks we build\n- how well we organize information internally\n- how fast our team can find this information\n\nSales Enablement SHOULD be about:\n\n- how well the enabler understands real selling and buying pains\n- how many assets we build that can truly help the buying process\n- how well reps deliver relevant, digestible information to buyers\n- how effectively our team can help buyers make decisions\n\nWe could get away with it when the salesperson was the source of knowledge.\n\nWe could get away with it in a ZIRP, hire fast, and just get reps out there era.\n\nWe could get away with it when buyers weren't a group of 11 confused stakeholders, each using ChatGPT to form their own opinion, navigating 100 vendors per category, and facing CFOs in every approval process.\n\nBut it‚Äôs a different world now‚Ä¶\n\n69% of sales teams MISSED 2024.\n\nAnd if you think sales is complex, you‚Äôre missing the point‚ÄîBuying is.\n\nSales is hard because buyers are failing.\n\nBecause buyers are confused, stuck in indecision, and face unhelpful reps.\n\nAn effective enablement role and tech should FIX THAT.\n\nContent Management and L&D are not enough.\n\nWe should support Buyers as much as we support Sellers.\n\nFlip the script from Sales to Buyer Enablement.",

SE nowadays chops everything in tiny pieces and loses the bigger picture: there is no ONE buyer journey (at least not in my B2B high value business and I guess nowhere else either except transactional sales). So it's like playing chess and move with every move your buyer makes to both win. SE needs to support these kind of scenarios, be adaptable to the individual and foremost - enable instead of \"take over\" the thinking part. I see too many sales use AI infused SE and not get the conversion rates you would expect so just increase the volume. That's not where we need to land...",

You get unlimited generations!\n\nFree means you only get the stock shots.

It‚Äôs a reminder that great leaders don‚Äôt need to be distant or intimidating.\n\n‚Ä¢AI Insights\nReid is deeply invested in understanding how AI will reshape business and society.\n\nA few key takeaways from the video:\n\n- AI will act as a ‚Äúco-pilot‚Äù for professionals, enhancing creativity and decision-making.\n- It‚Äôs not about replacing humans but ‚Äúamplifying human potential‚Äù - think of it as a tool to solve problems faster and smarter.\n- The risks are real, but so are the opportunities. We need to design AI systems that ‚Äúkeep humanity connected‚Äù, not isolated.\n\n‚Ä¢Staying Ahead of Trends\nReid‚Äôs ability to stay updated with the latest trends, from AI to social media, is a lesson for all leaders. He doesn‚Äôt just talk about the future - he‚Äôs actively shaping it.\n\nHis approach is a blueprint for modern leadership - grounded, forward-thinking, and deeply human.\n\nLeaders, take note.\n\nFollow for more\n\nCredits: TikTok/@TedZhar",

I see that as a pretty unique combination of finding the right people but then having an organization that encourages and harnesses this type of innovation.\n\n We got a tour of their ATC, Advanced Technology Center, and within that, their AI Proving Grounds, where customers and partners converge to solve challenges with technology. With everything I saw, I'd say WWT is well down on a path on turning the next wave of AI powered innovations into a business accelerant.\n\n Thanks to our amazing hosts\n\n And yes, video(s) to come!",

It feels like we‚Äôre getting more done, but are we really?\n\nHere‚Äôs the hard truth: Multitasking is a myth!  Our brains aren‚Äôt wired to handle multiple tasks at once. What we call ‚Äúmultitasking‚Äù is actually task-switching‚Äîjumping between tasks at lightning speed. This constant switching doesn‚Äôt make us more productive; it actually makes us less efficient, more prone to mistakes, and mentally exhausted. ‚Äç\n\nScience backs this up! Studies show that our brains work best when we focus on one thing at a time. This is called monotasking, and it leads to deeper focus, better results, and reduced stress. \n\nIf you‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed by endless tasks, it‚Äôs time to shift gears! Here are 4 powerful strategies to stop multitasking and start working smarter:\n\n 1. Time Blocking ‚è≥ ‚Äì Break your day into dedicated time slots. Focus on one task for 20‚Äì30 minutes before moving to the next. This method improves concentration and helps you get more done with less stress.\n\n 2. Batch Your Emails  ‚Äì Instead of checking your inbox every 5 minutes, set specific times (e.g., morning, afternoon, and evening) to read and respond to emails. This stops constant distractions and gives you more uninterrupted work time.\n\n 3. Minimize Distractions  ‚Äì Silence notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and work in a quiet environment. Your brain needs deep focus to produce high-quality work!\n\n 4. Declutter Your Workspace  ‚Äì A messy desk leads to a cluttered mind. Keep your workspace organized to improve mental clarity and efficiency.\n\nThe key to real productivity isn‚Äôt doing more at once‚Äîit‚Äôs doing things with focus and intention!",

I didn't even know all the machine names.\n\nThat 'failure' made me gather all the names and find the manuals.\n\nThe next time someone asked me for a part number, I failed. So I created a list of all the part numbers.\n\nWhen someone asked for the name of other service techs that have worked on particular equipment, I didn't know. So I started making a contact list.\n\nOver time, failure became complicated. Because nature had shown me all the ways I could fail so that I could fix them.\n\nIn that way, failure isn't really thing. Its just a lesson to help us adapt and overcome.",

Breakdown:\n\nThe gist is I sort of like the different writing style (it cuts through the noise) but the fundamentals are just off.\n\nWhat's right:\n\nThe way it's written definitely makes me keep reading. I don't know if it's because I'm amused by the writing style, but it definitely gets my attention.\n\nWhat's wrong with this:\n\n1. Subject line: If you're using that as a subject line, you better be able to back it up and tie it in with the copy. Otherwise, it's like using \"re:\" ‚Äì people hate it.\n\n2. Where you found me: I'm all for humor and cheesy lines, but not if you can see right through them. This + using text-based \"expressions\" is a bit of a turn-off.\n\n3. Prospect fit: Would you offer leads to a lead gen agency? Probably not. At least not framed like this.\n\n4. Company name formatting: This is where they really lose me. Not formatting your company names to remove how they're formatted on LinkedIn is a deal-breaker.\n\n5. The CTA asks for a call: I don't love this unless you've nailed the offer + relevance + social proof. Plus, how about that sign-off?\n\nThe military theme is kinda odd too...I think it could've been executed differently.\n\nProps on the social proof and good deliverability though.\n\nWhat do you think of this? Am I being too harsh?",

Moved to selling / leading teams at a great product\n\nWhy is this such a dangerous combo?\n\nIf you've only played a video game on Rookie Mode, you can't master it. It's only when you win the game in Legendary Mode that you actually understand it.\n\nSimilarly, if you've never sold a really mediocre product, you often lack the creativity and grit to figure things out when it gets hard. You don't understand the concept of \"make  happen\" and are reliant on great marketing, product, inbounds, support, brand to pave the way to deals.\n\nOnce you've learned how to use only your own sales skills to win deals, then you can literally sell anything.\n\nAdd to that a really strong product, brand, and momentum ... that's where the magic happens.\n\nI'll never forget when, one of the best sellers I've ever worked with, moved from a shitty adtech company where we crushed deals together ... to Pinterest. I visited him a few months into his new role, where he had quickly become one of the top sellers.\n\nFinn and I had worked together for 2+ years and cleverly found a bunch of hacks to increase email opens / responses by using a bunch of data enrichment, had to go through all sorts of gymnastics to get deals done.\n\nWhen he got to Pinterest, he was stunned that the cold email every single sales rep used basically read:\n\n===\n\nSubject: Mark - Finn from Pinterest\n\nBody: \"Hi Mark - do you want to learn about how to run ads on Pinterest to grow your brand? Let's chat.\"\n\n===\n\nAfter years of trying every trick in the book to get meetings, and being damn good at it,\nsuddenly Finn went from playing on Hall of Fame mode to Rookie mode.\n\nBut instead of getting lazy and complacent, he continued to use his hard earned skills to outperform every other rep.\n\nThat's whatis taking about here. And it is an incredible profile to look for.",

In December 2021, it raised an undisclosed seed round, followed by a $244.08K funding round in June 2023. The sector itself is witnessing rapid growth, with increasing investor interest and new entrants.\n\nFor instance, last month, Tech4Billion Media, the parent company of Chingari, ventured into the spiritual tech market with the launch of AstroLive. Similarly, Kuku FM introduced its Bhakti app at Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, which saw an impressive 500K downloads during its testing phase.\n\nThe spiritual market, valued at $58.86 billion in 2023, is projected to witness substantial growth, with an expected annual CAGR of 10% through 2032.

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today‚Äôs AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

        "content": "I'm 43.\n\nAfter 12 years bootstrapping, growing Groove to $5M ARR, and leading a team of passionate builders, I've made just about every entrepreneurial mistake in the book.\n\nHere are 10 pieces of brutally honest founder advice (I wish someone had told me day one):\n\n1. Create one true believer. To get traction, you don't need 1000 customers or investors. You need one customer who believes in you. Find them, deliver exceptional value, and they'll become your biggest evangelist.\n\n2. Data beats intuition. Intuition means scaling only with gut feelings. Data means gathering real customer feedback and using it to become customer-obsessed. Let the data do the heavy lifting.\n\n3. Take calculated risks. Bootstrapping a SaaS company was terrifying. But I didn't jump blindly. I tested, learned, and built a path. Run experiments first. Focus on small wins to reduce uncertainty. Big dreams are scary, but calculated risks are where growth happens.\n\n4. Systematic execution is the requirement. When I launched Groove, I planned, tested, and refined that business. I was methodical, sometimes to a fault. If you're not systematic, someone else who is will out execute you. Success isn't genius... it's process.\n\n5. Handle feedback thoughtfully. In tough situations, write the response or email, then wait 24 hours before sending. You'll almost always revise it with a clearer head‚Äîand build better relationships in the process.\n\n6. Being a student is the fastest way to grow. I worked with every customer I could, I learned everything they could teach me about their needs. Find successful companies in your space, and study what works for them. Shortcuts don't exist‚Äîbut learning accelerates the journey.\n\n7. Never waste a good crisis. In the late 2010's our growth dropped from 100% to 30% monthly growth. It felt devastating, but I used it as an opportunity to rethink the approach. We created efficiency throughout the company and became incredibly focused. Six months later we rebounded with our strongest quarter ever.\n\n8. The most important decision you'll make is choosing what to focus on. The best investment wasn't in features, it was in understanding customers. Your priorities will shape your business more than anything else. Choose wisely.\n\n9. The top performers live in the details. The difference between good and great is in the small things. At Groove, our retention grew because we paid attention to the details others overlooked (like response times, onboarding flow, customer feedback loops).\n\n10. No milestone makes you successful. There's no void to fill. When I hit my first million in ARR, I thought the achievement would fix everything (my doubts, my stress, my uncertainty). Reality check: it didn't. No number can make you feel fulfilled. True satisfaction comes when you realize you're building something valuable all along.\n\nWhat principle had the biggest impact on your business journey? ",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today‚Äôs AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

So we built the podcast I *wished* existed. It asks all the questions I desperately wanted podcast hosts to ask.\n\nWe named it tl;dr because that‚Äôs exactly what it is.\n\nIt starts with a 1-2 minute episode summary. At the very start I tell listeners: ‚ÄúIf this responates with you listen along, otherwise‚Ä¶ honestly, don‚Äôt. Check out a different episode instead‚Äù And I mean it.\n\nWe skip the ‚Äútell us about your journey‚Äù and dive straight into the execution details:\n\nHow did they actually do it?\nWhat went wrong?\nWhat would they do differently?\n\nAnd this format has been a game-changer.\n\nWe've implemented insights from it across‚Äî partnerships, sales process, LinkedIn strategy, product-market fit, pricing models, and so so much more..\n\nAnd now, as we wrap up Season 1 and gear up for Season 2 next week, here are my top 5 must-listen episodes:\n\n1): I‚Äôm a little biased for this one because he talks about how we helped him with SEO. He also has another great episode that I‚Äôll link in the comments.\n\n2): This is unique because it was about R!B2B‚Äôs pricing. My favorite lessons in this were actually around building moats and offers.\n\n3): I don‚Äôt like the PMF definition of YC. It‚Äôs too vague. So I made my own; Mine was accurate but complicated. Rob shared a PMF definition that may just be my new favorite.\n\n4): I‚Äôve shared this episode the most. It is the best guide on partnerships I have ever seen. Period.\n\n5): He shared some great insights and also ended up coaching us on how to increase ACV. The most impressive part of this wasn‚Äôt just the tactics but how he managed it internally in his org.\n\nSeason 2 launches next week. We‚Äôre lining up some incredible guests like,and.\n\nI'll be pushing updates on LinkedIn for every new episode that drops.\n\n-\"super excited for season 2\" Shakunt\n\nAsk:  I‚Äôm looking to speak on more podcasts, can you connect me to any?",

It reinvents itself while most people are still clinging to ‚Äúthe way things have always been.‚Äù Industries are evolving, tech is rewriting the rules, and leadership? It‚Äôs no longer about control‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about adaptability.\n\nI‚Äôve spent years navigating systems built to exclude, watching businesses and leaders cling to outdated models, terrified to evolve. The ones who refused to pivot? They crumbled. The ones who embraced uncertainty? They thrived. Because here‚Äôs the truth: agility beats tradition every time.\n\n Survival isn‚Äôt about strength ~~> it‚Äôs about agility \n\n Adaptability Over Rigidity  Change isn‚Äôt a threat; it‚Äôs an invitation. Businesses (and people) who cling to ‚Äúthe way things have always been‚Äù will always be blindsided by the ones willing to move differently. If you‚Äôre still trying to force old models into new realities, you‚Äôve already lost. The ones who win are the ones building what‚Äôs next while others debate if change is necessary.\n\n Tech as a Tool, Not a Crutch  AI, automation, data‚Äîit‚Äôs all here, whether we like it or not. The key isn‚Äôt just using tech but understanding it. The difference between those who thrive and those who fade? One builds, the other reacts. Tech isn‚Äôt a replacement for thinking‚Äîit‚Äôs an accelerator for those who know how to use it.\n\n People Over Profits (But Let‚Äôs Be Real ~ Both Matter)  Leadership today isn‚Äôt about barking orders. It‚Äôs about creating an environment where innovation happens naturally. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúmanage‚Äù your way into relevance. You create environments where people thrive, or you become another cautionary tale. If you don‚Äôt empower them, you lose them.\n\nI don‚Äôt wait for change ~~> I move with it. I don‚Äôt just react <~~ I design. I don‚Äôt play it safe‚Ä¶ I move with intention. I architect the damn blueprint.\n\nThe future isn‚Äôt waiting. It never has. You evolve, or you fade.\n\n What‚Äôs one outdated business practice you think needs to go?\n\nDrop it in the comments. Let‚Äôs talk about building what‚Äôs next.",
