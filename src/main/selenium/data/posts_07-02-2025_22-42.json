        "content": "Last year, I spoke to the CRO of a $120M ARR SaaS who KILLED their Sales Enablement tech budget and moved back to Google Drive. Here's what went wrong (and why he called SE a \"big lie\"):\n\n\nCONVO RECAP:\n\nCRO: The entire concept of Sales Enablement is a big lie.\n\nMe: Ok, you got my attention… elaborate?\n\nCRO: Look at the tools and the ways people fill this role. I need my AEs to multithread, run better calls, build champions better, etc. But we’re paying [Top 3 enablement vendor] for soooo many bells and whistles, and what we end up with is basically a glorified Google Drive.\n\nMe: What do you think went wrong?\n\nCRO: These tools are solving for the wrong problem. Content Management isn't Enablement. It is a marketing/sales alignment problem, not a sales effectiveness one. Too many of the Enablement folks out there are really more L&D experts or marketers than sales experts, so the enablement tech giants focus on them.\n\nMe: So, what is Sales Enablement in your mind?\n\nCRO: Solving for better deal execution, a better workflow with our buyers, and insights about deals (not just how content is being used). And sales experts should run this. Our team ends up downloading and emailing content to clients, ignoring the tech. I don't need to pay $70,000 for what is essentially GDrive.\n\n\nMY THOUGHTS:\n\nThat might sound harsh, but let’s be honest—he’s not wrong.\n\nWe’re not enabling Sales if we’re not improving the Buyer-Facing Process.\n\nWe’re not enabling Sales if we’re not enabling Buyers.\n\nYears of ‘Growth At All Costs’ made us lose sight of what matters.\n\nSales Enablement should NOT be about:\n\n- how well the enabler knows how to train people\n- how many case studies and ebooks we build\n- how well we organize information internally\n- how fast our team can find this information\n\nSales Enablement SHOULD be about:\n\n- how well the enabler understands real selling and buying pains\n- how many assets we build that can truly help the buying process\n- how well reps deliver relevant, digestible information to buyers\n- how effectively our team can help buyers make decisions\n\nWe could get away with it when the salesperson was the source of knowledge.\n\nWe could get away with it in a ZIRP, hire fast, and just get reps out there era.\n\nWe could get away with it when buyers weren't a group of 11 confused stakeholders, each using ChatGPT to form their own opinion, navigating 100 vendors per category, and facing CFOs in every approval process.\n\nBut it’s a different world now…\n\n69% of sales teams MISSED 2024.\n\nAnd if you think sales is complex, you’re missing the point—Buying is.\n\nSales is hard because buyers are failing.\n\nBecause buyers are confused, stuck in indecision, and face unhelpful reps.\n\nAn effective enablement role and tech should FIX THAT.\n\nContent Management and L&D are not enough.\n\nWe should support Buyers as much as we support Sellers.\n\nFlip the script from Sales to Buyer Enablement.",

We say customer-centric and translate it to sales-centric. \"How fast & easy can I sell?\" Instead of the basics of selling: SMYKM and buyer enablement. SE nowadays chops everything in tiny pieces and loses the bigger picture: there is no ONE buyer journey (at least not in my B2B high value business and I guess nowhere else either except transactional sales). So it's like playing chess and move with every move your buyer makes to both win. SE needs to support these kind of scenarios, be adaptable to the individual and foremost - enable instead of \"take over\" the thinking part. I see too many sales use AI infused SE and not get the conversion rates you would expect so just increase the volume. That's not where we need to land...",

Should have known it would be like that. Learning from experiences that are bad, avoid the bad experiences and don’t waste time learning from them. I wonder how many people would agree with you sentiment? It’s just not accurate. Smart people learn from people that are where they want to be or have been where they don’t what to end up. That’s why coaches who’ve experienced troubled times are so damn good. They help avoid those mistakes and decisions.",

You get unlimited generations!\n\nFree means you only get the stock shots.

Here are some \"lies\" I heard along the way:\n\n “𝐋𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐢𝐬𝐧’𝐭 𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬.”\nEver tried fixing a contract mess after things go south? It’s painful. Getting your legal documents right from the start is not a luxury—it’s survival. (Shoutout tofor making this easier for founders like me!)\n\n “𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐚 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭.”\nNope. Plans change. What you need is momentum. Start, adjust, learn, and keep going.\n\n “𝐈𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭, 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞.”\nI wish. Even the best product needs marketing, storytelling, and a LOT of follow-ups.\n\n “𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲’𝐥𝐥 𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐮𝐭.”\nNot really. Even the best team needs clarity, direction, and a culture that helps them thrive.\n\n “𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤-𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐦𝐲𝐭𝐡 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬.”\nIt’s tough, but burnout helps no one. Taking time off isn’t a weakness—it’s what keeps you in the game longer.\n\nWhat’s a common “lie” you’ve heard in your journey?",

No pretense, no ego - just a genuine conversation about the future. It’s a reminder that great leaders don’t need to be distant or intimidating.\n\n•AI Insights\nReid is deeply invested in understanding how AI will reshape business and society.\n\nA few key takeaways from the video:\n\n- AI will act as a “co-pilot” for professionals, enhancing creativity and decision-making.\n- It’s not about replacing humans but “amplifying human potential” - think of it as a tool to solve problems faster and smarter.\n- The risks are real, but so are the opportunities. We need to design AI systems that “keep humanity connected”, not isolated.\n\n•Staying Ahead of Trends\nReid’s ability to stay updated with the latest trends, from AI to social media, is a lesson for all leaders. He doesn’t just talk about the future - he’s actively shaping it.\n\nHis approach is a blueprint for modern leadership - grounded, forward-thinking, and deeply human.\n\nLeaders, take note.\n\nFollow for more\n\nCredits: TikTok/@TedZhar",

This is a trait you see within certain people, maybe associated with \"grit\", where someone \"gets it\" and can make things happen regardless of obstacles.\n\n WWT folks shared numerous stories without consciously realizing that many were all similar instances of being presented a challenge, and not just overcoming the challenge, but actually turning it into business growth, or a new business unit. I see that as a pretty unique combination of finding the right people but then having an organization that encourages and harnesses this type of innovation.\n\n We got a tour of their ATC, Advanced Technology Center, and within that, their AI Proving Grounds, where customers and partners converge to solve challenges with technology. With everything I saw, I'd say WWT is well down on a path on turning the next wave of AI powered innovations into a business accelerant.\n\n Thanks to our amazing hosts\n\n And yes, video(s) to come!",

        "content": "Are You a Multitasker or a Monotasker?  \n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, we’re constantly juggling emails, meetings, deadlines, and social media notifications—all while trying to stay productive. It feels like we’re getting more done, but are we really?\n\nHere’s the hard truth: Multitasking is a myth!  Our brains aren’t wired to handle multiple tasks at once. What we call “multitasking” is actually task-switching—jumping between tasks at lightning speed. This constant switching doesn’t make us more productive; it actually makes us less efficient, more prone to mistakes, and mentally exhausted. ‍\n\nScience backs this up! Studies show that our brains work best when we focus on one thing at a time. This is called monotasking, and it leads to deeper focus, better results, and reduced stress. \n\nIf you’ve been feeling overwhelmed by endless tasks, it’s time to shift gears! Here are 4 powerful strategies to stop multitasking and start working smarter:\n\n 1. Time Blocking ⏳ – Break your day into dedicated time slots. Focus on one task for 20–30 minutes before moving to the next. This method improves concentration and helps you get more done with less stress.\n\n 2. Batch Your Emails  – Instead of checking your inbox every 5 minutes, set specific times (e.g., morning, afternoon, and evening) to read and respond to emails. This stops constant distractions and gives you more uninterrupted work time.\n\n 3. Minimize Distractions  – Silence notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and work in a quiet environment. Your brain needs deep focus to produce high-quality work!\n\n 4. Declutter Your Workspace  – A messy desk leads to a cluttered mind. Keep your workspace organized to improve mental clarity and efficiency.\n\nThe key to real productivity isn’t doing more at once—it’s doing things with focus and intention!",

That last one stings.\n\nHere’s the thing, high achievers struggle the most with this.\n\nBecause the smarter you are, the better you are at making failure sound logical.\n\nHere’s how you can break the overthinking cycle:\n\n1️⃣ Give yourself no more than 10 seconds to make decisions. If you sit on it for days, you’ll talk yourself out of it.\n\n2️⃣ Assume you’ll probably fail, or at least suck initially… then do it anyway. Why? Because failing forward still beats standing still.\n\n3️⃣ Start tracking “decisions made” instead of just “decisions perfected.” You don’t win by being perfect. You win by moving first.\n\nMost people lose, not because they made the wrong decision, but because they never made a decision at all.\n\nTake action today homies!",

I didn't even know all the machine names.\n\nThat 'failure' made me gather all the names and find the manuals.\n\nThe next time someone asked me for a part number, I failed. So I created a list of all the part numbers.\n\nWhen someone asked for the name of other service techs that have worked on particular equipment, I didn't know. So I started making a contact list.\n\nOver time, failure became complicated. Because nature had shown me all the ways I could fail so that I could fix them.\n\nIn that way, failure isn't really thing. Its just a lesson to help us adapt and overcome.",

Breakdown:\n\nThe gist is I sort of like the different writing style (it cuts through the noise) but the fundamentals are just off.\n\nWhat's right:\n\nThe way it's written definitely makes me keep reading. I don't know if it's because I'm amused by the writing style, but it definitely gets my attention.\n\nWhat's wrong with this:\n\n1. Subject line: If you're using that as a subject line, you better be able to back it up and tie it in with the copy. Otherwise, it's like using \"re:\" – people hate it.\n\n2. Where you found me: I'm all for humor and cheesy lines, but not if you can see right through them. This + using text-based \"expressions\" is a bit of a turn-off.\n\n3. Prospect fit: Would you offer leads to a lead gen agency? Probably not. At least not framed like this.\n\n4. Company name formatting: This is where they really lose me. Not formatting your company names to remove how they're formatted on LinkedIn is a deal-breaker.\n\n5. The CTA asks for a call: I don't love this unless you've nailed the offer + relevance + social proof. Plus, how about that sign-off?\n\nThe military theme is kinda odd too...I think it could've been executed differently.\n\nProps on the social proof and good deliverability though.\n\nWhat do you think of this? Am I being too harsh?",

Moved to selling / leading teams at a great product\n\nWhy is this such a dangerous combo?\n\nIf you've only played a video game on Rookie Mode, you can't master it. It's only when you win the game in Legendary Mode that you actually understand it.\n\nSimilarly, if you've never sold a really mediocre product, you often lack the creativity and grit to figure things out when it gets hard. You don't understand the concept of \"make  happen\" and are reliant on great marketing, product, inbounds, support, brand to pave the way to deals.\n\nOnce you've learned how to use only your own sales skills to win deals, then you can literally sell anything.\n\nAdd to that a really strong product, brand, and momentum ... that's where the magic happens.\n\nI'll never forget when, one of the best sellers I've ever worked with, moved from a shitty adtech company where we crushed deals together ... to Pinterest. I visited him a few months into his new role, where he had quickly become one of the top sellers.\n\nFinn and I had worked together for 2+ years and cleverly found a bunch of hacks to increase email opens / responses by using a bunch of data enrichment, had to go through all sorts of gymnastics to get deals done.\n\nWhen he got to Pinterest, he was stunned that the cold email every single sales rep used basically read:\n\n===\n\nSubject: Mark - Finn from Pinterest\n\nBody: \"Hi Mark - do you want to learn about how to run ads on Pinterest to grow your brand? Let's chat.\"\n\n===\n\nAfter years of trying every trick in the book to get meetings, and being damn good at it,\nsuddenly Finn went from playing on Hall of Fame mode to Rookie mode.\n\nBut instead of getting lazy and complacent, he continued to use his hard earned skills to outperform every other rep.\n\nThat's whatis taking about here. And it is an incredible profile to look for.",

In December 2021, it raised an undisclosed seed round, followed by a $244.08K funding round in June 2023.

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

        "content": "I'm 43.\n\nAfter 12 years bootstrapping, growing Groove to $5M ARR, and leading a team of passionate builders, I've made just about every entrepreneurial mistake in the book.\n\nHere are 10 pieces of brutally honest founder advice (I wish someone had told me day one):\n\n1. Create one true believer. To get traction, you don't need 1000 customers or investors. You need one customer who believes in you. Find them, deliver exceptional value, and they'll become your biggest evangelist.\n\n2. Data beats intuition. Intuition means scaling only with gut feelings. Data means gathering real customer feedback and using it to become customer-obsessed. Let the data do the heavy lifting.\n\n3. Take calculated risks. Bootstrapping a SaaS company was terrifying. But I didn't jump blindly. I tested, learned, and built a path. Run experiments first. Focus on small wins to reduce uncertainty. Big dreams are scary, but calculated risks are where growth happens.\n\n4. Systematic execution is the requirement. When I launched Groove, I planned, tested, and refined that business. I was methodical, sometimes to a fault. If you're not systematic, someone else who is will out execute you. Success isn't genius... it's process.\n\n5. Handle feedback thoughtfully. In tough situations, write the response or email, then wait 24 hours before sending. You'll almost always revise it with a clearer head—and build better relationships in the process.\n\n6. Being a student is the fastest way to grow. I worked with every customer I could, I learned everything they could teach me about their needs. Find successful companies in your space, and study what works for them. Shortcuts don't exist—but learning accelerates the journey.\n\n7. Never waste a good crisis. In the late 2010's our growth dropped from 100% to 30% monthly growth. It felt devastating, but I used it as an opportunity to rethink the approach. We created efficiency throughout the company and became incredibly focused. Six months later we rebounded with our strongest quarter ever.\n\n8. The most important decision you'll make is choosing what to focus on. The best investment wasn't in features, it was in understanding customers. Your priorities will shape your business more than anything else. Choose wisely.\n\n9. The top performers live in the details. The difference between good and great is in the small things. At Groove, our retention grew because we paid attention to the details others overlooked (like response times, onboarding flow, customer feedback loops).\n\n10. No milestone makes you successful. There's no void to fill. When I hit my first million in ARR, I thought the achievement would fix everything (my doubts, my stress, my uncertainty). Reality check: it didn't. No number can make you feel fulfilled. True satisfaction comes when you realize you're building something valuable all along.\n\nWhat principle had the biggest impact on your business journey? ",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today’s AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

Well, I am back lol\n\nIf you're going to personalize an email, at least do it right.\n They mention our 1M+ boxes shipped. Nice touch.\n Then they try to bribe me with a STANLEY mug… for a 10-minute call?\n And they didn’t even research that we already sell on Amazon?\n\nLet’s break this down.\n1️⃣ Personalization should feel genuine.\nThrowing in a random stat about my company isn’t personalization. It’s just copy-pasting from my website. If you want my attention, show me you actually understand my business.\n2️⃣ Are people really booking meetings for a STANLEY mug?\nMaybe I’m off here, but if someone is willing to give you time just for a freebie, are they really a serious buyer? Probably not.\n3️⃣ You’re an Amazon expert, but you didn’t check that we already sell on Amazon?\nSo let me get this straight. You want me to trust you with my Amazon growth, yet you didn’t even verify that we already have a store? Why would I believe you can help me if you didn’t do the most basic research?\nIf your cold email strategy is just blasting generic messages hoping something sticks, you are doing it wrong.\n\n Here’s the fix:\n Actually research before you hit send.\n Personalization means more than just pulling one stat.\n If you want trust, don’t act like an email spammer.\n\nBecause if you are blindly mass-emailing potential clients, why should they trust you to be any different with their business?",

So we built the podcast I *wished* existed. It asks all the questions I desperately wanted podcast hosts to ask.\n\nWe named it tl;dr because that’s exactly what it is.\n\nIt starts with a 1-2 minute episode summary. At the very start I tell listeners: “If this responates with you listen along, otherwise… honestly, don’t. Check out a different episode instead” And I mean it.\n\nWe skip the “tell us about your journey” and dive straight into the execution details:\n\nHow did they actually do it?\nWhat went wrong?\nWhat would they do differently?\n\nAnd this format has been a game-changer.\n\nWe've implemented insights from it across— partnerships, sales process, LinkedIn strategy, product-market fit, pricing models, and so so much more..\n\nAnd now, as we wrap up Season 1 and gear up for Season 2 next week, here are my top 5 must-listen episodes:\n\n1): I’m a little biased for this one because he talks about how we helped him with SEO. He also has another great episode that I’ll link in the comments.\n\n2): This is unique because it was about R!B2B’s pricing. My favorite lessons in this were actually around building moats and offers.\n\n3): I don’t like the PMF definition of YC. It’s too vague. So I made my own; Mine was accurate but complicated. Rob shared a PMF definition that may just be my new favorite.\n\n4): I’ve shared this episode the most. It is the best guide on partnerships I have ever seen. Period.\n\n5): He shared some great insights and also ended up coaching us on how to increase ACV. The most impressive part of this wasn’t just the tactics but how he managed it internally in his org.\n\nSeason 2 launches next week. We’re lining up some incredible guests like,and.\n\nI'll be pushing updates on LinkedIn for every new episode that drops.\n\n-\"super excited for season 2\" Shakunt\n\nAsk:  I’m looking to speak on more podcasts, can you connect me to any?",

        "content": " The Future of Business: \nAdapt or Be Left Behind \n\nThe world isn’t waiting for anyone. It moves. It shifts. It reinvents itself while most people are still clinging to “the way things have always been.” Industries are evolving, tech is rewriting the rules, and leadership? It’s no longer about control… it’s about adaptability.\n\nI’ve spent years navigating systems built to exclude, watching businesses and leaders cling to outdated models, terrified to evolve. The ones who refused to pivot? They crumbled. The ones who embraced uncertainty? They thrived. Because here’s the truth: agility beats tradition every time.\n\n Survival isn’t about strength ~~> it’s about agility \n\n Adaptability Over Rigidity  Change isn’t a threat; it’s an invitation. Businesses (and people) who cling to “the way things have always been” will always be blindsided by the ones willing to move differently. If you’re still trying to force old models into new realities, you’ve already lost. The ones who win are the ones building what’s next while others debate if change is necessary.\n\n Tech as a Tool, Not a Crutch  AI, automation, data—it’s all here, whether we like it or not. The key isn’t just using tech but understanding it. The difference between those who thrive and those who fade? One builds, the other reacts. Tech isn’t a replacement for thinking—it’s an accelerator for those who know how to use it.\n\n People Over Profits (But Let’s Be Real ~ Both Matter)  Leadership today isn’t about barking orders. It’s about creating an environment where innovation happens naturally. You can’t “manage” your way into relevance. You create environments where people thrive, or you become another cautionary tale. If you don’t empower them, you lose them.\n\nI don’t wait for change ~~> I move with it. I don’t just react <~~ I design. I don’t play it safe… I move with intention. I architect the damn blueprint.\n\nThe future isn’t waiting. It never has. You evolve, or you fade.\n\n What’s one outdated business practice you think needs to go?\n\nDrop it in the comments. Let’s talk about building what’s next.",

It changed everything.\n\n\nSee, I'm the type who wants to do everything:\n\n• Launch a YouTube channel\n• Build multiple products\n• Speak at conferences\n• Create online courses\n• Start a podcast\n• Write a book\n\nBut with a 2.5-year-old toddler and family commitments, that's a recipe for disaster.\n\nSo, I flipped the script.\n\nBefore I started my business,, 4 months ago, I created a \"Must Not Do\" list for year one:\n\n1. No long-form YouTube videos\n2. No hiring full-time employees\n3. No launching another course\n4. No spreading myself too thin\n5. No video podcast\n\nThe result?\n\nClarity. Focus. Peace.\n\nAnti-goals aren't about limiting yourself.\n\nThey're about protecting your most valuable resources:\n• Your time\n• Your energy\n• Your family moments\n\nAt this stage in my career, those are the things that matter most.\n\nHere's the truth:\n\nYou can do anything, but not everything at once.\n\nSometimes, the path to success isn't about what you do.\n\nIt's about what you consciously choose not to do.\n\nWhat's on your anti-goals list for 2025?",
