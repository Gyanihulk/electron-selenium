        "content": "Oman Introduces New Regulations for Part-Time Work\n\nThe Ministry of Labour has rolled out Ministerial Decision No. 13/2025, introducing updated regulations for part-time work across Oman.\n\nThis decision is set to reshape employment opportunities for a wide range of individuals, including students, job seekers, retirees, and current employees looking for flexible work arrangements.\n\nHere are the key highlights:\n Flexible Opportunities for Students:\nStudents aged 15 and above can now take on part-time jobs with parental approval. Importantly, they don‚Äôt need permission from their schools or universities, provided their work doesn‚Äôt interfere with academic responsibilities.\n\n Defined Part-Time Hours & Wages:\nPart-time work is capped at 25 hours per week (minimum of 4 hours per day), with a minimum wage of RO 3 per hour. However, employers and employees can agree on a lower rate if needed.\n\n Omani Nationals First:\nThe decision ensures that part-time opportunities are reserved for Omani nationals, aiming to boost local employment.\n\n Worker Protections in Place:\nEmployers must adhere to occupational health and safety standards, provide training, and ensure timely wage payments. Part-time workers are also required to be registered in the Social Security Fund.\n\n Recognition for Experience:\nStudents will receive experience certificates for the time worked, adding value to their professional development early on.\n\nThis move strikes a balance between promoting flexible work opportunities while safeguarding the well-being and growth of the workforce, especially young students eager to gain real-world experience.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these new regulations? Could this inspire other countries to adopt similar policies to support youth employment and flexible work? Let‚Äôs hear your insights!",

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today‚Äôs AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

I've taken more risks in life, burned more boats, blown up the bridges and some were huge wins and some were not.\n\nNow I speak about what I learned from those experiences and deliver it through coaching, advising, working with smart people to close their gaps so they can be successful.\n\nIt took me 20 years to unlearn, relearn, and think differently and If I can save that timeline for you I will be grateful.\n\nMy biggest goal for 2025 is to impact the lives of 2000 people through my coaching, advising, and speaking.\n\nThanks- See you at dinner soon buddy.",

She made vulnerability her superpower.\n\nOprah shared her personal struggles - poverty, abuse, weight issues - and turned them into a source of strength for millions.\n\n2. She championed empowerment.\n\nFrom her book club to her leadership academy, she‚Äôs always focused on lifting others up.\n\n3. She mastered the art of connection.\n\nWhether interviewing celebrities or everyday people, Oprah made everyone feel seen and heard.\n\nThe best part?\n\nShe‚Äôs still the same authentic, empathetic person who started her show in 1986.\n\nHer success formula is simple but powerful:\n\n Be unapologetically yourself\n Use your platform to make a difference\n Stay consistent, even as you evolve\n\nAnd her audience? They‚Äôre LOYAL.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Oprah never lost her \"girl from Mississippi\" vibe.\n\nP.S. What do you think about Oprah and her journey?\n\nÔ∏è Repost if you enjoyed this breakdown.",
