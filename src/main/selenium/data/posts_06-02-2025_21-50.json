No fluffy goals here.\n\nStep 2: Choose the Right Tech Stack: Don’t just go trendy. Pick tech that actually fits what you’re building and scales smoothly.\n\nStep 3: Implement Agile Methodologies: Keep things flexible and fast. Agile isn’t just a buzzword - it’s your roadmap to quicker, smarter iterations.\n\nStep 4: Automate Testing: Bugs aren’t cute. Get automated tests running early and keep them going to squash bugs before they bite.\n\nStep 5: Use DevOps Practices: Fuse your development and operations teams. Tighten up the feedback loop and pump out updates faster and more reliably.\n\nStep 6: Monitor Performance: Keep your eyes on the prize. Use real-time monitoring to know exactly how your application is performing and what your users are saying.\n\nStep 7: Iterate Based on Feedback: Act on what you learn. Update your software regularly based on real user feedback and hard data. Keep evolving.",

Without it, your chances of achieving your goals are virtually zero.\n\nClarity is the foundation of everything in leadership and teamwork. It means having a crystal-clear understanding of your goals, your roles, and your plan of action. Yet, so many projects, strategies, and initiatives falter because people are left guessing. Guessing what success looks like. Guessing who’s responsible for what. Guessing the next step.\n\nWhen there’s no clarity:\n Effort is wasted on the wrong priorities.\n Miscommunication leads to conflict and frustration.\n Teams lose motivation because they can’t see a clear path forward.\n\nOn the other hand, when clarity is present:\n Teams align and work with purpose.\n Productivity soars as people know exactly what’s expected.\n Confidence builds because everyone understands how success will be achieved.\n\nClarity doesn’t just improve your odds of success—it guarantees you’ll avoid failure caused by confusion and misalignment. Every great achievement starts with the leader painting a vivid picture of what success looks like.\n\nRemember, confusion kills execution. Success starts with clarity. Always.\n\nRepost this to help your network & follow me Gordon Tredgold for more content like this.",

These weren’t just casual chats they were eye-opening lessons that shaped the way I think about growth, innovation, and opportunities.\n\n A Goldmine of Knowledge: The best part? Being surrounded by people more knowledgeable than me. When you’re constantly in a room full of smarter, more experienced individuals, you’re bound to learn something new every single time. These conversations exposed me to fresh ideas, new trends, and cutting-edge technologies that I might have missed otherwise.\n\n The Growth Mindset Shift: Over time, I realized that attending tech events wasn’t just about networking it was about evolving. Every event pushed me to step outside my comfort zone, think bigger, and take action on new insights. Now, I make it a priority to attend as many events as my time permits because I know that each one brings an opportunity for growth.\n\nIf you’re skipping tech events, you might be missing out on the connections, knowledge, and mindset shifts that could take you to the next level. Don’t wait start showing up, start learning, and start growing!\n\nHave you ever had a life-changing experience from a tech event? Or do you regret skipping one? Let’s discuss! \n\nand for students do you prefer a day college or a day tech event..?",

Tomide Williams.\n\nBefore LinkedIn, I was just a 9-5 girlie.\n\nWork hard.\nDo your best.\nGet promoted.\n\nThat was the plan. Nothing more.\n\nBut by the end of 2024? I had multiple business ideas.\nIdeas I was willing to execute.\nI had connected with a community that saw beyond just “work.”\nI had learned how to express myself, beyond my job title.\n\nAll because I saw someone doing more.\n\ndoesn’t just talk about excellence.\nHe lives it.\nEvery time I think I’m doing a lot, I look at his status, he’s doing 10x more.\n\nOrganizing ads, mentoring students, building projects.\nAnd I can’t count the number of times that has challenged me.\n\nBut beyond that, there’s something else I’m grateful for, our conversations.\n\nWe haven’t had many (life is busy), but the ones we’ve had? Life-changing.\n\nWe talk about purpose, business, community, God’s will.\n\nAnd each time, I leave with a bigger mindset.\n\nSo today, I just want to say thank you,.\nFor inspiring me.\nFor challenging me.\nFor unknowingly expanding my world.\n\n\n\nDear friends,\n\nIf you’ve ever had a mentor, a coach, or even a friend whose work ethic and mindset made you see life differently, tag them below.\n\nP.S. Who’s that person you want to celebrate today?\n\nLet’s give them their flowers. \n\n________________________\n\nHello fellow sun-ray, I’m, the ProductQueen. I’m passionate about building products that solve deep needs and drive sustainable impact.\n\nSome decisions may seem small, but they can change everything. This post is proof. \n\nFollowfor a mindset shift.\n\n#",

What if the key to lasting success isn’t in massive leaps but in small, intentional steps? Enter micro-goals.\nMicro-goals are bite-sized, achievable objectives that keep you moving forward without the weight of overwhelming expectations. They create a roadmap of consistent progress, fostering a sense of accomplishment with each milestone reached. Whether it's reading ten pages a day, dedicating five minutes to mindfulness, or reaching out to a mentor weekly—these small actions compound into transformative results over time.\nTo young leaders and dreamers: remember that success isn’t a sprint; it's a marathon of meaningful strides. Set clear, specific micro-goals for February. Celebrate your wins, learn from your challenges, and stay committed to the journey.\nYour future self will thank you for the steps you take today.",

        "content": "A CEO friend of mine raised $40M at $400M valuation. Two years later? The money’s gone and his ARR is flat. If you asked him the biggest mistake he made he would tell you: hiring salespeople. Here's why:\n\nTo be clear, it wasn’t JUST hiring salespeople… It was HOW he hired them.\n\nAnother founder buddy of mine recently did a Private Equity (PE) round.\n\nHis investors were pushing him to grow his team of reps from 5 to 20.\n\nFortunately, my PE backed friend talked to my CEO friend first.\n\nHere's how that conversation went:\n\nPE Backed Friend (PBF): We just raised $25m and they want us to hire a bunch of salespeople.\n\nCEO: Of course they do. But don’t do it yet. That pressure is EXACTLY what smoked me, wasted 2 years and $40m, and very likely shaved 10 years off my life.\n\nPBF: Ok… well… what do I do?\n\nCEO: Are all of your reps at 100%?\n\nPBF: Not really. One might be, the rest aren’t.\n\nCEO: Do not hire ONE MORE REP until ALL of your reps are at 100% capacity. If you build a machine that has slack in it already, you will experience all sorts of cultural and motivational problems. The same amount of demos your marketing machine is creating and reps are capturing will go to even MORE people. Your team will miss numbers week in and week out. You will attempt to solve that problem by demanding reps you hired to be AE’s do more and more outbound. That will not work. Your sales leader will probably either quit or be fired, because you’ll have the exact same productivity on 4x the team size.\n\nPBF: That’s terrifying. Especially now that we’re PE backed.\n\nCEO: Tell me about it.\n\nPBF: What do I do instead?\n\nCEO: Before you hire a SINGLE REP, make sure all of your reps are at 100% capacity. Make sure your marketing machine can actually produce more pipeline. If and when you can actually flood your reps with activity and the entire team is at 100%…\n\nPBF: Then I hire reps?\n\nCEO: NO!!!! Absolutely not. You work on raising the 100% higher. Figure out how you increase the capacity of the existing team to handle the increased pipeline generation. Can you create AI agents that save account research and follow up time? Can you hire sales assistants to do some of the unavoidable repetitive work? ANYTHING to get your already 100% capacity reps more productive. THEN… AND ONLY THEN… Do you start slowly adding reps onto the team.\n\nPBF: I am so glad I spoke to you before I did anything.\n\nCEO: Me too.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nInstitutional capital still wants to push founders into rapidly hiring reps to accelerate growth.\n\nWhile that sometimes works, it’s VERY easy to do it the wrong way.\n\nWhat’s the RIGHT way?\n\n1. Make sure your marketing machine can grow\n2. Get all your reps to 100% capacity\n3. Raise that capacity as much as possible\n4. Slowly add reps to THAT machine\n\nBuild your team that way and you can’t lose.",

        "content": "I’m terrified of hospitals. But my knee surgery showed me how Revenue Teams should improve their Buyer Experience.\n\nYesterday, I underwent a minor knee surgery. A simple meniscus repair.\n\nNow, I’m afraid as hell of needles, blood, knives—anything remotely medical. But from the moment I stepped into the hospital, I felt an unexpected sense of calm.\n\nWhy?\nBecause of two things:\n\n 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀: Everything was structured. Every step before, during, and after surgery followed a simple, scalable process—checklists.\n\n‍‍ 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲: Everyone, from the nurse to the anaesthetist to the surgeon, focused on making me feel at ease through human connection and collaboration.\n\nEven during surgery, my surgeon explained each step, ensuring I understood what was happening. It transformed what should have been a stressful experience into a great experience.\n\nNow, here’s my takeaway for B2B tech:\n\n What if we treated customer experience the same way hospitals treat patient care?\n\nToo often, marketing, sales, and customer success operate in silos—handing customers off between teams like a game of hot potato. But in world-class hospitals, every single person follows the same playbook.\n\n𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝘀 = A Well-Documented Process of What Good Looks Like. I know how much you like this️\n\nEvery action, from pre-surgery prep to post-op care, follows a proven checklist refined over decades.\n\nWhether it’s a minor procedure or complex surgery, everyone in the hospital aligns on a single process.\n\nB2B teams can do the same. Imagine:\n Marketing, Sales & CS using the same \"checklist\" for buyer & customer success.\n A collaborative, frictionless experience across the entire customer journey.\n A playbook that ensures every customer interaction is seamless.\n\nThe best customer experiences are not random. They are engineered through repeatable, scalable processes—and they are delivered by people who care.\n\nSo, here’s my question for you:\n\n What’s one process or \"checklist\" that transformed your GTM motion?\n\n𝙋𝙎. Since July 2022, I’ve archived 6,000+ GTM insights from top Revenue Leaders. Now, you can turn their advice into ready-to-use checklists—Disco, Demo, Closing, and more.\n\n Subscribe to my newsletter to get practical breakdowns on how these checklists can drive impact for your revenue team.\n\n\n--\n️ 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁 to help other Revenue Leaders.\n 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 any Revenue question with the trained GPT.\n 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲 to my Newsletter for Weekly Revenue Tips.",

Adding one more question here: ask yourself thid: “What is stopping me from delegating?” \nIf your answer is “I’m the only one who can do it best,” it’s time to face the fact that you're the bottleneck. This usually points to control issues or a failure to trust your team. To make them \"the best people to do it best\" they need to learn new skills and for that they need to practice :)\n\nIf it’s “I don’t have time for it,” you need to step up and build better structures and processes—not just for your team, but for your own work.\n\nAnd if it’s “I’m afraid I’ll lose control,” then you need to get comfortable with letting go. True leadership means empowering others to take ownership and rise up to meet challenges. You don’t lose control; you gain leverage by trusting your team’s capabilities.",

Companies will start consolidating sales teams.\n\nLong-Term (2032-2037 | 10-12 Years) → Full Obsolescence\n\nAI will handle most transactional sales conversations and even many complex ones, leaving only industry specialists and highly strategic sellers.\nSales teams will keep only those who:\n Have deep industry expertise\n Understand business strategy beyond just selling\n Can leverage AI effectively rather than compete with it\n\n Impact: By 2035-2037, companies won’t need these reps anymore. The top 20% of salespeople will dominate.\n\nFinal Verdict: Timeline to Obsolescence\n\nAI will start catching up to “good” sellers in 5-7 years (2030-2032).\nThey will start losing job security by 2032-2035.\nBy 2037, if they haven’t specialized or evolved, they will be fully obsolete.\n\nIf they want to stay relevant past 2035, they must:\n Deeply specialize in an industry (not just hop jobs)\n Invest in strategic knowledge (not just sales tactics)\"\n\nMe: It's 2025...time to get to work",

I'm surprised that it didn't highlight some of the oft-overlooked soft skills as a differentiator that helps top performing sellers to continue to be relevant. Obviously, this is a probable outcome based on predictions from AI, but I believe that as much as people embrace AI more over time, there will also be a growing desire for human connection in a world overflowing with AI automation. Sellers (and business professionals in general) who can demonstrate their experience and expertise through exceptional story telling, provide authentic human interactions, and demonstrate critical thinking skills will be the ones who will continue to thrive. *Caveat - if they TOO leverage AI. Those skills alone will not secure one's place. They will be a necessary compliment to required AI skills in a world lacking the human interaction that so many will crave.",

To assist fellow developers,\n\n️I'm sharing a curated list of essential questions and answers that have been pivotal in my preparation journey. Let's empower each other to succeed! \n\nKey Questions Covered:\n\nWhat are meta tags in HTML?\nMeta tags provide metadata about the HTML document, such as descriptions, keywords, and author information, which help with search engine optimization and browser behavior.\n\nCan you explain the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?\nvar is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped. const is used for variables that shouldn't be reassigned, whereas let is suitable for variables that will change.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the HTML 'doctype' declaration?\nThe <!DOCTYPE> declaration informs the browser about the HTML version and how to render the document, ensuring consistent display across browsers.\n\nHow does CSS specificity work?\nCSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules match. It's calculated based on the types of selectors used: inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, and element selectors.\n\nWhat is a closure in JavaScript?\nA closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when executed outside that scope. This feature allows for data encapsulation and the creation of private variables.\n\nLet's continue to learn, share, and grow together in this ever-evolving field.

        "content": "Here's how we've grown TACK into a seven figure business.\n\nThe first thing we did was think about the story we wanted to tell the world. We were very intentional with what we were trying to say and build.\n\nWe named the business TACK because the word is a sailing term, which is a maneuver that involves turning the bow of a boat through the wind to change direction.\n\nSo we took that idea and turned it into a metaphor for business. A business never goes from point A to point B in a straight line. You have to zig and zag to grow. TACK helps businesses find the right tack for their stage, their market, their product, and their customers.\n\nWe took it one step further and named a new way to think about how to grow your business.\n\nWhy? Because we noticed massive shifts happening and business and marketers need new ways to grow. The biggest thing we identified is, companies match how they market and sell to the why people like to buy things today. The gap between the two continues to increase unless you take a different approach.\n\nWe named the problem Company-first GTM.\n\nWe call the new approach People-first GTM. A business strategy that uses storytelling, relationships, and partnerships to create, capture, and convert demand into revenue. It’s designed to put people at the center of every interaction and experience.\n\nI share all this because we are using a People-first GTM strategy to grow TACK and the first thing you need to do is identify and write down your business's stories. The founding story and the problem story.\n\nWe built three resources to help people understand and implement the strategy. Drop 'people' in the comments if you want all three.\n\nFrom there, you can start to think through the different channels and offers you can use to acquire and retain customers.\n\nIt all starts with Partner-led Growth. We use it for co-marketing, co-selling, and co-servicing. I'll do a whole other post on how we do it. But TACK would not be nearly as successful if we didn't have a very partner strategy. It helps us create a high margin business.\n\nCommunity-led Growth powers our audience building and we use LinkedIn and private communities to activate this strategy. It's about finding the right networks to use to grow a rented audience. I say rented because you don't technically own any of the networks or communities.\n\nWe then built a Member-led Growth strategy. We created our own community called TACK Insider. It's packed with resources and benefits to help marketers become go-to-market leaders and learn People-first GTM. We knew we had to find a scalable way to bring the concept to people.\n\nCustomer-led Growth is how we are able to continue growing with great margins. We're able to expand and grow with our customers, and they are able to help us acquire more new customers.\n\nAlright, I ran out of characters. I'll share more later about how we use content-led growth and a little bit of event-led growth.",

        "content": "BIOMIMICRY CONTINUUM – Part 4 – Update Agent LEARNING\nFundamental evidence of learning is the ability to recall and utilize what is learned. Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (,)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine () provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",

As tennis champions don't win by receiving, great leaders don't succeed by taking - they triumph by giving.\n\nThe serve initiates every point.\nLeadership initiates every breakthrough.\n\nConsider this:\n↳ Your serve: Setting clear VISION\n↳ Their return: Team ENGAGEMENT\n↳ Your volley: Supporting GROWTH\n↳ Their shot: Innovation and RESULTS\n\nBut here's the real game-changer: In tennis, the most powerful serves aren't about force but precision and purpose. The same holds in leadership.\n\nQuestion:\n• When was the last time you assessed your \"service game\" as a leader?\n• Are you hitting with power but missing the court entirely?\n\nThis week, focus on one way you can better serve your team. It could be removing obstacles, providing clarity, or simply listening without judgment.\n\nRemember: The scoreboard of leadership isn't measured by your titles, but by the success of those you serve.\n\nGame. Set. Impact.\n\nCoaching works; let's work together. | Follow\n\n Book Your Coaching Discovery Session Today:",
