It's why we only scratch the surface of what we are capable of. \n\nLast week, I led a workshop with CEOs, founders, and high-achievers to explore what holds us back from our reaching \"impossible\" goals and full potential.\n\nWhat struck me wasn't the differences between us ‚Äì it was the similarities.\n\n\"I'm not disciplined enough.\"\n\"I don't have the right connections.\"\n\"I'm scared of scaling.\"\n\"I need to be more confident.\"\n\nThese weren't the voices of newbies. These were the honest reflections from achievers who've already proven themselves ‚Äì yet still wrestle with the same doubts we all do.\n\nThen something wonderful happened.\n\nWe flipped the script. Instead of focusing on what we lacked, we imagined who we needed to become.\n\nThe energy shifted from \"I can't\" to \"What if?\"\n\nThe most powerful realization: Your impossible goal isn't about having all the answers ‚Äì it's about being willing to question your assumptions about what's possible for you, for your business and for what you want most.\n\nOne CEO summed it up perfectly: \"I am my past self's dream.\"\n\nThink about that for a moment. You've already achieved what once seemed impossible to your younger self.\n\nYour next impossible goal is just waiting for you to reimagine what's possible.\n\nAfter all, imagination doesn't just help us dream ‚Äì it helps us see opportunities where others see constraints.\n\nWhat's your impossible goal for 2025?\n\nMore importantly, who do you need to become to achieve it?\n\n_________________________________\n\nIn 2025, you could look back at this moment as the turning point where you decided to become the person who achieves the impossible. Let's map out that journey together.\n\nI work with accomplished executives to break through self-imposed limitations and achieve what they once thought impossible. We'll transform your \"someday\" goals into actionable steps through a unique blend of imagination expansion and strategic planning.\n\nBook a complimentary Impossible Possibility Strategy Session to explore how we can make your biggest goals a reality.",

I hope this helps you grow and print some $$$$.\n\nYou see, I've been writing LinkedIn only for fun‚Äîall ad hoc stuff. I didn't use it to sell until a student told me that they didn't know of my offerings because they never saw them.\n\nThen I saw the power of LinkedIn to print money. Most of my customers are from here.\n\nI made one mistake - I know you'll say CRINGE.\n\nI used my personal photos because the algorithm promotes them. This gave me an array of likes and followers‚Äîso many of them.\n\nI still like them, even on others, but not all the time. I think they add a personal touch but irrelevant selfies are, well... irrelevant.\n\nSo I pivoted my strategy a few months ago where I used more quotes. Here's what happened:\n likes went down\n went down\n‚¨ÜÔ∏è engagement increased\n‚¨ÜÔ∏è SALES increased $$$$$\n\nBecause I was putting relevant content.\n\nThis relevant content did not have\n- my personal diary thoughts\n- 'how to grow on LinkedIn'\n- 'how to grow personal brand'\n- paid engagement (fun fact: any post that has the same number of comments as likes = paid comments )\n\nI feel all this has been easy to do because I love, love, and write for the love of it. I don't care about the numbers increasing online (only in my bank account ).\n\nI have no attachment to the outcome.\n\nI hope this helps you.\n\nThis is one of the many instances over the last three years in the creator economy that keep proving that likes/followers and money aren't directly proportional.",

But let‚Äôs face it‚Äîit‚Äôs easy for spending to drift away from what really matters.\n\nPurposeful spending isn‚Äôt about cutting back or feeling guilty. It‚Äôs about making sure your money works for the things you truly care about. Here‚Äôs how to bring more intention to your spending:\n\n1. Clarify Your Core Values. Start by writing down what‚Äôs most important to you‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs family, adventure, giving back, or achieving financial peace of mind. These values will serve as a guide for your financial decisions.\n\n2. Set Goals That Inspire You. Big or small, goals give you a reason to spend with intention. Whether it‚Äôs saving for a dream vacation, helping loved ones, or supporting a cause, make them personal.\n\n3. Track Where Your Money Goes. Take a month to review your spending through the lens of your values. Look for patterns and ask yourself, ‚ÄúDoes my spending reflect what‚Äôs important to me?‚Äù\n\n4. Simplify Your Spending Plan. A plan doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated or restrictive. Focus on covering your needs, saving for the future, and spending on what brings you joy.\n\n5. Pause Before You Purchase. Before you hit ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù take a moment to ask yourself: ‚ÄúWill this bring me joy? Does it align with my values and support my goals?‚Äù A small pause can help you avoid regret and make choices you feel good about.\n\n6. Invest in Line with Your Values. Your investments can reflect what you stand for too. Consider supporting companies and industries that align with your principles‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs renewable energy, ethical business practices, or groundbreaking innovations.\n\nPurposeful spending turns everyday decisions into steps toward a more fulfilling, meaningful life. It‚Äôs not about less‚Äîit‚Äôs about better.",
