The struggle with negative dynamics within oneself is not an obstacle but an invitation to deeper self-awareness. As we encounter and heal our own internal struggles, we begin to see them mirrored in others—not as a curse, but as an opportunity for connection and growth.\n\nThe process of awakening involves recognizing that the boundaries between self and others are more porous than they appear. The same energies that create friction within can manifest externally, forming relationships with individuals who reflect these patterns. This isn’t coincidence; it’s a call to transmute these energies into understanding, compassion, and healing.\n\nEstablishing close contact with others who mirror our struggles is not a setback, but an alignment with the law of resonance. These connections provide opportunities for mutual healing, and through love, empathy, and shared growth, both individuals can transcend their limiting patterns. Awakening isn’t just an internal journey; it’s a shared experience, where one soul’s evolution catalyzes the transformation of another.",

Meta said it will spend as much as $65 billion on capital expenditures as it works to construct more data center and computing infrastructure.\n\nAmazon gave an update on its spending plans after reporting mixed results for the fourth quarter. The company projected weaker than expected sales for the current period, which overshadowed a beat on the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter.

I'm really impressed by [specific achievement]. I'm currently seeking opportunities in [specific role] at [Company], and I’d be grateful for any insights or advice you could share.\"\n\n This shows you've done your research and respect their time.\n\n[2] Be Clear About Your Ask\n️ Example:\n\"Would you feel comfortable referring me for [specific position] at [Company]? I’ve attached my resume and can share more details if needed.\"\n\n Be direct but polite. Avoid vague requests like \"Help me find a job.\"\n\n[3] Show Genuine Interest in the Person\n️ Example:\n\"Your post about [topic] resonated with me, especially your perspective on [specific point]. I’d love to hear your advice on navigating a career in [industry].\"\n\n Build a connection before making a request.\n\n[4] Offer Value in Return\n️ Example:\n\"If there’s any way I can support you, such as sharing your projects or helping with [specific task], please let me know.\"\n\n Referrals are a two-way street—always think about how you can give back.\n\n[5] Follow Up Graciously\n️ Example:\n\"Hi [Name], I hope you're doing well! Just following up on my earlier message. I understand you might be busy, but I’d appreciate any guidance you could provide. Thank you!\"\n\n A polite follow-up shows persistence without being pushy.\n\n\n Don'ts\n\n[1] Don't Send Generic Messages\n Example:\n\"Hi, can you refer me to your company?\"\n\n This gives the impression that you're copy-pasting messages.\n\n[2] Don't Focus Solely on Your Needs\n Example:\n\"I need this job urgently; please help me.\"\n\n Make the conversation about mutual value, not desperation.\n\n[3] Don’t Skip Basic Research\n Example:\n\"Hi, I’m interested in [Company]. Can you tell me more about it?\"\n\n Always research the company and role before reaching out.\n\n[4] Don’t Be Overly Persistent\n Example:\n\"Why haven’t you replied?

        "content": "Most people think the interview starts with the first question. \n\nIt doesn’t.\n\nBy the time you shake hands and sit down, decisions are already being made about you.\n\nFirst impressions are fast, brutal, and if you’re unprepared its impossible to recover from.\n\nHere’s how to make sure you own those critical first five minutes:\n\n1️⃣ Your interview starts before you arrive.\n\nThat means the moment you leave your house, you’re “on.” The receptionist? The person in the elevator? They might have more influence than you think. Treat everyone like they’re the hiring manager.\n\n2️⃣ First impressions are non-verbal.\n\nA firm handshake, eye contact, and a confident posture will do more for you than a perfect answer. Nervous energy is contagious—so is confidence.\n\n3️⃣ Small talk matters.\n\nDon’t just answer questions—engage. If you can’t hold a conversation about anything but work, you’re missing a huge opportunity to build rapport.\n\n4️⃣ Know your three key points.\n\nPoliticians do it. CEOs do it. You should too. What are the three things you want the interviewer to remember about you? Repeat them naturally throughout the conversation.\n\n5️⃣ Do your homework.\n\nIf you can’t explain what the company does or why they’re hiring you’ve already lost. Nothing says “I don’t really care” like being unprepared.\n\nI’ve seen people sabotage their chances before the first question is even asked. Don’t be one of them.\n\nThanks for checking this post!\n\nP.S.\n\nI have a newsletter where I help 100,000+ people learn AI and monetize their skills.\n\nSubscribe here for free:\n\nYou'll get 4 of our best courses for free when you subscribe.\n\nFollow me atfor more content like this.\n\nAnd repost this to help others land their dream jobs faster.",

And let’s be honest: If someone impresses you while skiing and discussing investing, they’re onto something.\n\nEach ValueX participant received a copy of his book, 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿, which was just released. It’s a deep dive into:\n\n️ What makes a successful value investor\n️ Understanding risks\n️ Different investment approaches\n️ The psychology behind investing\n… and much more.\n\nWhat’s even more remarkable? All proceeds from the book go to thecharity (FT FLIC), 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻.\n\nAnd here’s another refreshing part: Ardal is in his 𝟯𝟬𝘀. It’s about time we hear more from young investors - not just the 𝘰𝘭𝘥 𝘨𝘶𝘺𝘴 like myself.\n\nHighly recommended read! And big thanks tofor making sure we all got a copy at ValueX.",

Entrepreneurs. Creators. Anyone who wants to stop being invisible and start being unforgettable.\n\nSo, here’s the question:\nIf your business disappeared tomorrow, would people still know who you are?\nIf that hit a nerve, we should talk.\n\n Curious?

What do I do?”\n\nI get it, I do. And listen, you can have both.\n\nBut it’s all in HOW you ask about it.\n\nWe can certainly ask about work life balance directly *but*... let’s talk about how we can do it differently.\n\nWhy?\n\nRemember, this interview right here: it’s a sales call.\n\nYou are IN a sale.\n\nAnd because of this, you need to be aware of 2 things:\n\n1. How you may be perceived\n2. The answers you get may not always be accurate\n\n>> If you ask about balance, it may come across as not willing to put in the long hours\n\n>> If you don't ask, you may enter into a situation that doesn't work and be looking to jump ship again quickly (yikes!)\n\nTo find out what 'balance' really means, try this:\n\n>> Ask specifics about the team, their lives, the boss's favorite place to vacation, etc.\n\n>> Ask how the interviewer has found their team performs best with their work schedule re: flex work, remote work, vacations.\n\n>> Glean what you can from stories and examples -- they're more accurate than what hiring managers are allowed to share, in many cases.\n\n** And now, the most important part: L I S T E N **\n\nListen.\nTake notes.\nDraw conclusions.\nTalk to past employees.\nTalk to current employees.\n\nThe interview is a sale. A fact-finding mission.\n\nBut it’s all in the way that you do it.\n\nThen, you make the call.\n\nDoes this sound like a place where you fit?\nWhat’s your gut feeling about it?\n\n__________________________\n\n  My name is Claire and I'm a Medical Sales Resume Writer, LinkedIn Profile Writer, and Brand Strategist.\n\n(after 5 Layoffs, you get really good at it!)\n\nWhether you:\n\n>> Want to break into med sales\n>> Keep coming up 2nd in the final\n>> Have a resume that's not winning interviews\nwe'd love to position you for those Biotech, MedTech, Device, or Pharma roles you want.\n\n\n--> Hit the bell on my profile  so you never miss a post or guide.\n\n--> DM me!  for resume help and LinkedIn profiles that sell.\n\n_________________________",

Reading\n\nA 2009 study found that reading for just six minutes can reduce stress by up to 68%\n\nTry this:\n\n• Read 20 pages every night.\n• Listen to one podcast episode\n• Absorb one audiobook chapter before bed.\n\n2. Take a course\n\nDedicate time for focused learning to expand your skillset.\n\nThe formula:\n• Choose one skill to master.\n• Study for 45 minutes.\n• No phone, no distractions.\n\nAim for the same time each evening to build consistency.\n\n3. Work on a side project\n\nSide projects are a great way to learn, explore your passions, and feel energized.\n\nHere's a simple approach:\n• Block out 90 minutes.\n• Work on one project only.\n• Zero distractions.\n\nFocus on making consistent, incremental progress.\n\n4. Build your network\n\nReal relationships can significantly expand your opportunities.\n\nTry this:\nReach out to two new connections on LinkedIn each week for a virtual coffee chat.\n\n5. Exercise\n\nExercise strengthens your body, and movement unlocks mental clarity.\n\nHere's a starting point:\n\n• 30 minutes of walking.\n• Leave your phone behind.\n• Aim for before 8pm.\n\n6. Master a hobby\n\nHobbies are incredibly valuable for sparking creativity and developing new skills.\n\nChoose one and dedicate time:\n• Learn an instrument (30 mins daily).\n• Build something (1-hour blocks).\n\nWhile consuming content can be enjoyable, creating something of your own builds a deeper sense of accomplishment.\n\n7. Evening writing\n\nAn intentional evening routine often leads to a more productive morning.\n\nTry this evening routine:\n• Brain dump by writing for 15 minutes.\n• Plan tomorrow in 15 minutes.\n\nThis isn’t about perfectly optimising every minute.\nIt’s about making small, intentional swaps that add up over time.\n\nWhat’s one small change you’ll make tonight?\n\n️ Share this to inspire someone.\n Follow me,, to stay in touch.",

Check your inner-self:\n↳ What does your heart (not just your head) say?\n↳ Whose interests are they serving?\n\n\nIMPORTANT TRUTH: A truly wise person knows that there is something to be learned from everyone but not everyone has learned what they share.\n\nSome of the best advice you will ever get will come from your gut instinct.\n\nHere’s how I coach people on this topic:\n\nSTEP 1)\nSelf-awareness: Catalog moments where your intuition proved right. Map the feeling to the outcome.\n\nSTEP 2)\nPractice: Start small. Trust your gut on minor decisions and track results.\n\nSTEP 3)\nEvaluation: Review outcomes of intuition-based choices. Build confidence through pattern recognition.\n\nThe first step to success is believing in your instincts.\n\nHave a great weekend,\n\n\nCoaching works; let's work together.\n Book Your Coaching Discovery Session Today:",

They don’t disappoint:\n 0-100 km/h in 3.4 seconds (Yes, that’s proper sports car territory.)\n 33 sensors + 2 LiDAR units for next-level autonomous driving.\n️ Dual refrigerators (because why the hell not? )\n\nBut the real showstopper?\n\n “Crab-Walk” mode is a game-changer for parallel parking and tight spots. No more awkward back-and-forth. Just glide in sideways. (Check out the video)\n\nOh, and despite the “luxury” label, it comes in at ~$50K. \n\nBYD is bringing the Z9 GT to Europe soon.\n\nThe big question: Can European automakers keep up with China’s EV momentum?\n\n\n\n----\n Follow me,, for daily insights on AI, leadership, and technology.\n️ Like and share if you found this valuable!",

It also will include access to OpenAI’s newest agent feature, once it launches: a tool called “𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵” which OpenAI says will be able to conduct multistep analysis on the web. SoftBank branded all the OpenAI products it will use as a suite of tools “𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲”\n\n, the British chip designer acquired by SoftBank in 2016, will also use OpenAI tools to “boost productivity across the company”.\n\nAt a livestreamed event early Monday morning, which was jointly held by SoftBank, OpenAI and Arm executives in the audience represented companies that collectively accounted for more than half of Japan’s total market capitalization.\n\nDuring the presentation, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said that he believes\nor\na vaguely defined benchmark referring to AI that equals or surpasses human intellect on a wide range of tasks will be a reality in fewer than 10 years.\n\nSon said he believes “AGI can be achieved in large enterprise businesses first,” adding that to achieve it, “quite the huge amount of money is necessary” and that such funds are “only available in large enterprises at the moment.”\n\nDuring the presentation Monday morning, Son said he was looking forward to working with OpenAI, Oracle and others on the Stargate project.\n\nOpenAI was last valued at $157 billion by private investors. In late 2022, the company launched its ChatGPT chatbot, kicking off a boom in Generative AI.\n\nOpenAI closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, gearing up to aggressively compete with Elon Musk’s xAI, as well as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Anthropic.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese startup lab\nhas gone viral in the U.S, presenting fresh competition to OpenAI. DeepSeek saw its app soar to the top of Apple’s App Store rankings last week and roiled U.S. markets on reports that its powerful model was trained at a fraction of the cost of U.S. competitors.",

        "content": " When governments demand tech companies bypass encryption in the name of national security, where should we draw the line between privacy and public safety? \n\n**Executive Summary**\n1️⃣ Apple faces unprecedented pressure from UK authorities to create tools that could weaken device encryption protections—a move experts warn could set a dangerous global precedent for digital privacy.\n2️⃣ This standoff reveals the growing tension between law enforcement’s need to access data for investigations and the tech industry’s responsibility to protect user security.\n3️⃣ Legal analysts suggest this case could reshape international data protection laws, potentially creating conflicting standards across borders.\n\n**My Take**\nWhile combating crime is critical, creating intentional vulnerabilities in encryption is like building a bank vault with a master key hidden under the doormat. Once such tools exist, they become targets for bad actors and authoritarian regimes alike. The real challenge lies in developing investigative methods that don’t compromise the security of billions of devices.\n\n**The Future**\nExpect three key developments:\n1. Increased use of “security localization” laws requiring companies to store regional user data locally\n2. More advanced privacy tech like quantum-resistant encryption gaining mainstream adoption\n3. Growing demand for open-source security solutions as trust in corporate/government systems erodes\n\n**What You Should Think About**\n- Would you trust any organization to responsibly manage encryption backdoors?\n- How should multinational companies navigate conflicting international privacy laws?\n- What alternative investigation methods could satisfy both security and privacy needs?\n\nLet’s start a conversation—share your perspective below.  How would you balance these competing priorities as a tech leader?\n\nSource: Washington Post ",

        "content": "A few months ago, I sat across from a CEO who was frustrated beyond belief. \n\nHe’d invested in employee engagement initiatives—wellness programs, team-building events, trendy new office layouts—but nothing was moving the needle. Retention was still a mess. Performance was inconsistent. Morale was low.\n\n“HR keeps throwing new ideas at the problem,” he said, “but I don’t need more ideas—I need results.” That’s when it hit me. HR isn’t failing because of a lack of effort. It’s failing because it lacks standards.\n\n“Your life changes the moment you raise your standards.” The same is true for HR.\n\nHR is like the Wild West—everyone’s doing their own thing. We run endless engagement surveys but never establish clear frameworks to act on the data. We launch new initiatives but fail to define what success looks like.\n\nHow do you apply this? Stop chasing trends. Instead, define standards for every critical HR function—recruiting, onboarding, performance management, compensation.\n\nWhat does “excellent” look like? What are the non-negotiables that drive results? Make them clear. Make them measurable. Then stick to them.\n\nThe best HR strategies fail not because they’re bad ideas, but because they lack clarity and execution.\n\nThink about this- When an airline hires a pilot, they don’t just say, “Fly the plane however you want.” They have checklists, protocols, and standards to ensure every flight is safe and consistent.\n\nYet in HR, we expect generalists—people managing everything from hiring to payroll to compliance—to operate without clear guidelines. And then we wonder why HR struggles to deliver consistent results.\n\nHR needs a structured playbook. Don’t leave execution up to individual interpretation. Build clear frameworks, automate processes, and make standards the system, not the exception.\n\nIf an HR department isn’t taken seriously, it’s because leadership tolerates mediocrity.\n\nHR has tolerated its own inconsistency for too long. Instead of leading the charge on strategic impact, we’ve settled for the latest buzzwords—“culture,” “engagement,” “employee experience”—without backing them up with systems that deliver results.\n\nHR leaders must demand better. We need to shift the conversation from engagement scores to measurable workforce impact. From exit surveys to retention KPIs. From trends to tested, repeatable solutions.\n\nStart now. Identify one core HR process in your organization that lacks clear standards—whether it’s hiring, onboarding, or performance reviews. Define what “great” looks like. Write it down. Implement it. Make standards your foundation, not an afterthought.\n\nHR isn’t failing because it doesn’t care. It’s failing because it hasn’t committed to a higher standard.\n\nStandards create trust, results and credibility.\n\nIf you’re serious about fixing HR, it’s time to stop playing small.\n\nRaise your standards.\nBuild the system.\nLead the change.",

But somehow it grew into an agency.\n\nAfter a modest exit in 2018, I took a short break and traveled through France in a camper van.\n\nMy phone rang.\n\nIf I was interested in acquiring an agency.\n\nThey had clients. They had good MRR. They were solid.\n\nThose 6 agency years were amazing but rough. It didn't feel right.\n\nI went back into freelancing and started helping startups and scaleups. One-off identity and web projects. It was a temporary move.\n\nA tech scaleup found my work on Dribbble and asked if I'd be interested in an interim position as an Art Director. I took it.\n\nI built a creative team, revamped the brand, redesigned multiple platforms, and created 100s of brand assets.\n\nThen I was asked to be Head of Design at a fintech scaleup. I was responsible for their rebranding, building a team, working with many stakeholders, and creating countless brand assets.\n\nWe even saw our work in Times Square (twice).\n\nI worked with amazing people. We did great things. But something felt off.\n\nI had never been employed. But it felt like I was.\n\n11 years had passed since I started my agency.\n\nI had been going full throttle. I was ready for change.\n\nI pulled myself out of a rat race that I created.\n\nNo income for months. Turned down opportunities. But I didn't care. I was on a mission.\n\nI shared my experiences on LinkedIn. I wrote about all the stuff in this post. I wrote to attract peers and new kinds of opportunities.\n\nI had never been employed. It started to feel that way.\n\n30 months later, I'm in control. I love what I do. I have amazing clients. Made new friends. And creation has become an addictive daily activity.\n\nI created my own 'security'.\n\nYou see, opportunities come and go. But the best opportunities are the ones you create yourself.\n\nNow, this is a long post. I'm defying all LinkedIn algo rules here. No text formatting. No tips and tricks.\n\nIt's simply a story that hopefully encourages people to do what they should be doing.\n\nWrite, share, experiment, and surprise yourself and others.\n\nTake a risk. Your professional life and sanity depend on it.\n\nI've never been employed. And today it feels that way.",

        "content": " The One Leadership Mistake That Costs Companies Millions\n\nMost leadership mistakes don’t show up immediately.\nThey compound over time—until the cost is unrecoverable.\n\nThe #1 mistake?\nLeaders scaling themselves too slowly while the business scales too fast.\nA company can outgrow its leadership just as easily as it can outgrow its market.\nAnd by the time most leaders realize it, they’ve already become the bottleneck.\n\nA founder builds a business.\nThe business gains traction.\nThe company scales faster than expected.\nSuddenly, decisions take longer. Meetings become unproductive.\nExecution slows down. Top performers leave.\nAnd the same leader who drove the company forward becomes the constraint holding it back.\n\nThis happens at every stage of scale—from startup to IPO.\nThe difference between leaders who thrive and leaders who collapse?\nThey learn to scale themselves at the same speed as the business.\n\nThe Hidden Cost of Scaling Too Slowly as a Leader\n\n1️⃣ Slower Decisions = Missed Opportunities\n↳ A fast-scaling business requires faster judgment calls. When leaders hesitate, markets move on.\n↳ The most valuable skill at scale isn’t control—it’s trusting a system that moves without you.\n\n2️⃣ An Overloaded CEO = A Stagnant Company\n↳ If the business can’t run without the founder’s constant input, it’s not scaling—it’s stretching.\n↳ The best CEOs build autonomous teams so they can focus on vision, not operations.\n\n3️⃣ Failure to Delegate = Growth Plateaus\n↳ Many leaders think they’re protecting quality by staying involved in everything. They’re actually limiting scale.\n↳ The best leaders don’t just delegate tasks—they delegate decision-making authority.\n\n The Fix: Apply the OODA Loop for Leadership at Scale\n\nThe OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) was created for fighter pilots making split-second decisions.\nIt’s just as critical for leaders navigating high-growth environments.\n\n1️⃣ Observe: Read the Business in Real-Time\n↳ What’s happening now that you’re not seeing because you’re too deep in execution?\n↳ Data, team sentiment, and market shifts tell you where growth is breaking.\n\n2️⃣ Orient: Reframe How You See the Problem\n↳ The biggest leadership challenge isn’t decision-making—it’s context.\n↳ The question isn’t \"What should I do?\" It’s \"How should I be thinking about this?\"\n\n3️⃣ Decide: Reduce Friction in Decision-Making\n↳ The cost of waiting is often greater than the cost of being wrong.\n↳ Leaders who can’t decide quickly slow down the entire business.\n\n4️⃣ Act: Execute & Adapt Fast\n↳ Great leaders don’t just make decisions faster—they make them reversible.\n↳ \"If this fails, how quickly can I adjust?\" is the real leadership question.\n\nSpeed isn’t just about company growth—it’s about leadership adaptability.\nIf you’re navigating growth and feel like things are moving faster than you can adjust, let’s talk.\n\nFollowfor more content like this. Drop a comment or send me a DM—I’d be happy to dig into your biggest scaling challenge.",

Here’s how to actually analyze your cold email campaigns scientifically \n\nMost people ONLY look at reply rates and assume the highest is the best… \n\nBut if you're serious about cold email, you need to analyze:\n Reply Rate (Replies ÷ Sent)\n Positive Reply Rate (Positive Replies ÷ Sent)\n Sent-to-Positive Reply Ratio (How many emails → 1 positive reply)\n\nHere’s what we found after testing 5 email variations:\n⬇️ THE DATA THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS ⬇️\n\n Email Performance Breakdown:\n 1. Email – 601 sent\n 4.16% reply rate (25 replies)\n 2.00% positive reply rate (12 positive replies)\n 50.1 emails per positive reply\n\n 1. Email - A – 821 sent\n 4.14% reply rate (34 replies)\n 1.83% positive reply rate (15 positive replies)\n 54.7 emails per positive reply\n\n 1.

Email - D (Worst performer) – 1063 sent\n 1.22% reply rate (13 replies)\n 0.66% positive reply rate (7 positive replies)\n 151.8 emails per positive reply \n\nTHE TAKEAWAY?\n\nMore replies ≠ better campaign \n\nThe ONLY thing that matters is positive replies PER email sent.\nAnd that’s why Email B wins. \n\nStop guessing. Let the MATH guide your cold email strategy.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nP.s. Being a copywriter is overrated in 2025- just saying, AI can do that for you now... (P.s.

It will not lead you astray.\"\n(Meaning: Trust your inner desires and passions—they guide you to your authentic self.)\n\n\"When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy.\"\n(Meaning: True fulfillment comes from aligning your actions with your authentic essence.)",

Perception and action aren’t separate—they’re a continuous feedback loop of minimizing uncertainty.\n\nThis isn’t a patchwork of techniques.

And took deep, deep pleasure in telling him I wasn't interested.\n\nButremained undeterred. He took my objection and rebutted brillinatly.\n\n\"Hubspot, you say? What are you doing to enrich those leads?\"\n\nYou dirty dog, Asad. Clearly I was dealing with a pro.\n\nBut as I was getting ready to berate Asad for insinuating that I didn't know about lead enrichment... I remembered back to my own early days as an SDR. The grind of being on the phones. The pain of dealing with rejection after rejection. So I asked him:\n\n\"Asad, how long you been at Seamless for?\"\n\n\"Just a few months. Why?\"\n\n\"What's your last name, Asad? I'll give you something even better than a demo. I'll connect with you on LinkedIn. Full access to my 8323 followers.\"\n\nI had Asad give me his name.\n\nBut while claims to be calling from Seamless I had no way of knowing because he STILL HADN'T UPDATED HIS PROFILE PAGE YET!\n\nStrike two, Asady boy.\n\nSo I gave him another 15 minute lecture on the importance of brand building on LinkedIn.\n\nThe result?\n\nWe have a demo scheduled for Monday.\n\nIs it for a product I know I can't afford? It sure it is.\n\nBut that's showbiz baby.\n\nLet's show Asad some love and give him a follow for dealing with me.\n\nDude booked 30 meetings in his first month on the phones and has a 100% meeting conversion rate! (Soon to be 97% conversion rate)\n\nJust something to think about next time you listen to some corny influencer like me online versus just talking to someone who is actually in the trenches doing the work.\n\nCongrats on the new job, Asad.\n\nHere's your LinkedIn post.",
