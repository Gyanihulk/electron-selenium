      "content": "It was my birthday yesterday - one of those milestone birthdays where I knew I‚Äôd be a little bit moody so I took the day off work, a gift to myself. \n\nIt was a beautiful day and a first to walk the beach in winter. Frozen slabs of sand, laced with frosted sea foam was mystical. I chuckled at the warning signs - no sledding on the dunes‚ÄºÔ∏è I walked on a jetty - recalling days of my youth when my friend and I would fish off the jetty in Brigantine across the inlet from Atlantic City, well before casinos dotted the shoreline. Those boulders seemed so much flatter.\n\nI took the day to reflect on work goals, life goals, and the many blessings in my life. I have often described life as a pie to my children, explaining that not all wedges will be equally sized or sweet at a given point in time.\n\nIn recently moving, I unearthed a picture of me before one of my first interviews in Switzerland. Age 21, Montreaux.\n\nBack then, I had not set out to work in IT or analytics - I knew I was good at designing spreadsheets and personal databases, but I had no goals here. I only knew I had wanted to publish my first novel by the time I was 25. Instead, I did win a short story contest at 27 but I would be 33 before I published my first book. It was not the great American novel I had once imagined. It was the Great American Complete Reference book in Business Objects. Lesson: goals are malleable.\n\nWhen I first started BI Scorecard 20+ years ago, a tech partner asked me what my goals were. Goals? I thought it was lame to say, ‚Äúto provide a useful service, but basically, I‚Äôm just working to put my kids through college with as little debt as possible.‚Äù It just didn‚Äôt sound ambitious enough. I had worked 3 jobs to put myself through college and I didn‚Äôt want my kids to do the same. Mission accomplished.\n\nI think about how search and NLP first caught my attention in 2007 - for pete‚Äôs sake 16 years ago - and feel frustrated that as an industry we are not further along. And yet, I recall Hedy Lamarr who invented the code that led to wifi and blue tooth - it took 60 years for her work to reach mainstream.\n\nWe are at the cusp of NLP to finally democratize data - all data - and I have never been more excited. It clearly took some aligning of stars - cloud, digital transformation, and GenAI to educate the world about what‚Äôs possible. And of course, for people to be ready for change.\n\nWhether we are talking transformation or the measure of a life, it remains the people not the tech that determine success. I take joy in thinking about the lives I have touched and those that have touched mine. I was thrilled to get a text this week from a CDO who boldly accepted a job in a new industry. I feel his joy and his nervousness. It is an absolute privilege to support so many of you-whether on AI strategy or navigating power and politics or evaluating data science degrees and internships.\n\nOn this milestone birthday, I thank you for these many gifts & the years of serving our industry.",

If you‚Äôre a Wall Street Journal reader, you‚Äôll find my perspectives on topics such as the economy, politics, world affairs, and even occasional human interest stories.\n\nAnother key aspect of leadership is maintaining constant communication with your team to ensure alignment and transparency. It requires a shift in mindset‚Äîyou become unselfish, prioritizing the team‚Äôs success and focusing on empowering others to achieve their goals.\n\nBeing in a leadership role is one of the most transformative experiences a person can have.

Many people, much smarter than me, consider that Trumps second administration will represent a rapid and radical shift to the structure of globalisation that Davos itself has come to represent.\n\n2) AI will change everything, and I mean everything, and much faster than we expected. It‚Äôs even quite possible that we‚Äôve even reached a point of singularity (unstoppable, exponential intelligence). This will be more consequential than the emergence of electricity and the internet combined.\n\n3) Davos is a fantastic place to visit for someone like me, whose work involves organising a similar (albeit much smaller) global economic meeting like. The story of the UAE continues to fascinate and compel global business.\n\nIn summary: Davos 2024 = Probably more questions than answers.\n\n#FalconEconomy#CapitalOfCapital",

      "content": "Stay Safe on LinkedIn with These Smart Tips \n\nLinkedIn is a powerful platform for networking and career growth, but it‚Äôs important to protect your professional identity.\n\nUse these tips to stay secure while making the most of your LinkedIn experience!\n\n Tip 1: Customize Your Profile Visibility\nControl who can see your connections, activity, and contact information. Adjust your privacy settings so only trusted individuals can access sensitive details. For example, limit profile visibility to ‚ÄúConnections Only‚Äù for added security.\n\n Tip 2: Be Selective with Endorsements and Recommendations\nOnly accept endorsements and recommendations from people you‚Äôve worked with directly. This ensures your profile remains credible and avoids association with potentially fake or untrustworthy accounts.\n\n Tip 3: Verify Job Offers and Recruiters\nBefore responding to job offers or recruiter messages, research the company and individual. Check their LinkedIn activity, shared connections, and online presence to confirm legitimacy. Scammers often pose as recruiters to collect personal information.\n\n Tip 4: Avoid Sharing Sensitive Work Details\nRefrain from posting confidential company information, project specifics, or proprietary data on your profile or in updates. This protects both your employer and your professional reputation.\n\n Tip 5: Regularly Audit Your Connections\nPeriodically review your LinkedIn connections and remove any that seem suspicious or irrelevant. Keeping a curated network helps maintain the quality of your professional relationships.\n\n Tip 6: Monitor Login Activity\nUse LinkedIn‚Äôs tools to check recent login activity on your account. If you notice logins from unfamiliar locations or devices, update your password immediately and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).\n\n Tip 7: Be Wary of Suspicious Messages\nIf someone sends you a message asking for personal information or offering unrealistic opportunities, proceed with caution.

But months went by, and the promise remained unfulfilled. Her excitement turned into disappointment.\n\nNow, AAP's promise of ‚Çπ2,100 to all women has left me skeptical. Is this another empty promise?\n\nWe have already seen there history of unfulfilled promises - from providing clean water supply to building London-Paris like roads, from cleaning Yamuna to building 500 new schools.\n\nTo add insult to the injury, they had started registrations for the Mahila Samman Yojana just a month before elections. It's a blatant attempt to woo voters, and I'm not buying it.\n\nThe fact that they have dangled a higher amount of ‚Çπ2,100 if they wins the 2025 elections only adds to the skepticism.\n\nI look at Anita, who's now lost trust in the system. \"AAPda strikes again,\" I say, shaking my head.\n\nAnita nods in agreement, her eyes filled with disappointment.\n\nDelhi deserves better than empty promises and false assurances.",

Imagine lean operations empowered by automation, data that‚Äôs secure and ready, and AI project leaders delivering results! 3 simple hints below how to start!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Start with People\nAI transformation works best when it begins with your team. Upskilling and reskilling employees create AI-literate teams who manage data, adopt technology, and drive innovation. Investing in your people ensures lasting change and a culture of continuous improvement.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Strong Leadership is Key\nClear leadership roles are essential. The Chief Data Officer secures data integrity, while the Chief Digitalization or Transformation Officer drives AI projects, employee training, and process improvements. Together, they align AI strategies with the company‚Äôs vision for success.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Think Big, Start Small\nTransformation is a journey. Begin with small AI projects while organizing your data. Early lessons refine strategies and lay the foundation for scalable success. Pair this with marketing efforts to position your company as an AI leader, attracting talent and investors.\n\nAt, we‚Äôve seen what works: start small, learn fast, and build momentum. Launch pilot AI projects while refining your data strategy. Celebrate progress, share success stories, and position your brand as an AI leader. Transformation isn‚Äôt just possible. It‚Äôs essential.\n\n Ready to begin your journey? Let‚Äôs build the future together. ",
