We're living in a culture of power obsession, and it's killing our workplaces.\n\nThis is about us, our colleagues, our bosses, and our businesses. It's about how we've been prioritizing personal gain and power over love and connection. And let me tell you, it's not working!\n\nWhat if we flipped the script? What if we put love and connection first?\n\nResearch shows that workplaces prioritizing connection and empathy see a 50% reduction in staff turnover. Plus, an increase in productivity by 20%. That's huge!\n\nHere are some ways to bring love and connection into your workplace:\n\n- Start with empathy: Understand your colleagues' perspectives. Listen to their concerns.\n\n- Encourage collaboration: Foster a sense of teamwork. Make everyone feel included.\n\n- Promote open communication: Encourage honest feedback. Be transparent with your employees.\n\n- Recognize efforts: Celebrate small wins.
