      "content": "I recently spoke with a credit union that is using generative AI to handle customer requests for financial transactions. They have 12 to 15 support staff managing 6,000 members, so they were looking for ways to improve efficiency.\n\nThey believed they were taking a cautious approach. I asked them to describe their approach. They said they were going to limit the AI’s use to internal transactions within the credit union, apply transaction limits, and are testing it on 400 members before scaling further. However, this is not a sufficient stress test. The intent itself was flawed. Generative AI should not have been applied to financial transactions in the first place.\n\nThe challenge is that generative AI is becoming more accurate, making it harder to see the weak spots that still exist. Reliability remains a major concern because the failure cases do not always appear in a small-scale test. Issues often emerge under real-world conditions with more volume, unexpected inputs, and edge cases that were never part of the initial dataset.\nThere are several fundamental risks that are difficult to mitigate.\n\nHallucinations. AI can generate incorrect but plausible-sounding information. A misplaced decimal, a misinterpreted balance, or an inconsistent transaction status can have significant financial and compliance implications.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities. AI models are not designed with financial-grade security. They can be manipulated through subtle prompt engineering, making them susceptible to fraud in ways traditional rule-based systems are not.\n\nRegulatory liability. If the AI provides incorrect financial guidance or processes a transaction incorrectly, who is responsible? The credit union? The AI vendor? The customer?\n\nAI has value in financial services for tasks such as triaging inquiries, identifying fraud patterns, and supporting risk assessments. However, it is not a substitute for structured, deterministic transaction processing systems. The risks are too high, and the safeguards that seem sufficient in a controlled test often fail under real-world pressure.\n\nThis conversation reinforced a broader issue. Many organizations assume they are being cautious with AI implementation, but the reality is that generative AI is getting better at hiding its own weaknesses. The mistakes are less obvious, but they are still there. Without rigorous validation and resilience testing, financial institutions are exposing themselves to operational, security, and compliance failures that could far outweigh the cost savings.\n\nI would be interested in hearing how others are approaching AI in financial services. What strategies are being used to ensure true reliability and security?",

The answer from consumers is increasingly clear: no.\n\nPeople value AI for its efficiency, precision, and ability to solve problems—but there’s discomfort when AI becomes too human. Why? Because trust comes from transparency, not mimicry.\n\nAs businesses, this insight is a game-changer. It’s not about creating AI that feels human; it’s about creating AI that feels reliable, capable, and honest. Here’s how we get it right:\n\n Set clear boundaries: Let AI excel where it adds value, like automation, insights, and speed, while leaving empathy and nuanced decision-making to humans.\n Communicate its role: Be upfront with customers about what’s AI-driven and what’s not. Transparency builds confidence.\n Focus on outcomes: Customers care more about problem-solving than personality. Deliver value first.\n\nIn the race to innovate, let’s not lose sight of what truly matters: earning and maintaining trust. AI isn’t here to replace human connection—it’s here to enhance it.\n\nWhat’s your take? How do you balance AI innovation with authenticity?",
