These conversations give me:\n\n1. A clear lay of the land\n2. Insights into who‚Äôs who and what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes\n3. A chance to align myself with company priorities early on\n\nThis approach isn‚Äôt just networking; it‚Äôs strategic alignment. These relationships often pay dividends down the line.\n\n In my most recent role, I scheduled 17 one-on-ones over the course of two weeks! This intentional effort helped me feel extremely connected and supported by the two-month mark. Building these relationships early created a strong foundation for collaboration and trust.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Get Crystal Clear on Your OKRs and KPIs:\n\nUnderstanding exactly how my success will be measured is a game-changer. I make it a priority to discuss key metrics with my manager and other stakeholders to ensure I‚Äôm focused on the right priorities from day one.\n\nI also create a project or system to track my progress. This ensures I always have the latest and greatest insights on where I stand and can back it up with clear documentation. Having this visibility keeps me accountable and prepared for any performance discussions.\n\n Asana is my all-time favorite tool for this! I project manage nearly EVERY aspect of my life, personal and professional.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Build Your Organizational Toolkit:\n\nThe first 60 days are the perfect time to create systems that set you up for long-term success. Here‚Äôs what I focus on:\n\n1. A note-taking system to capture key insights from onboarding sessions and calls.\n2. A task management workflow to stay on top of daily and weekly priorities.\n3. A calendar strategy that includes blocking focus time and scheduling recurring meetings with key collaborators like managers, account executives, or solutions engineers.\n4. A praise bank system to store positive feedback, performance reviews, and personal success milestones. This also includes a space to track areas for improvement, ensuring I have a clear, balanced view of my growth and contributions.\n\nBeing organized early keeps me proactive, prepared, and ready to adapt to any challenges.\n\nWhat would you add to this list? Has anything resonated with you or sparked new ideas?\n\nShare your thoughts in the comments!",
