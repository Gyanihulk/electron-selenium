        "content": "NATIONAL SECURITY: The U.S. Navy has instructed service members to avoid using the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek, citing \"potential security and ethical concerns,\" according to CNBC.\n\nAn email sent to \"shipmates\" referenced the Navy's AI policy and emphasized the importance of refraining from using DeepSeek.\n\nThe memo warned service members against using the platform \"for any work-related tasks or personal use\" and instructed them to \"avoid downloading, installing, or using the DeepSeek model in any capacity.\"\n\nThe warning follows the recent rise of DeepSeek’s R1 model, which has demonstrated capabilities comparable to OpenAI’s models. In December, DeepSeek claimed it had successfully trained a large language model in just two months at a cost of $6 million despite U.S. restrictions on semiconductor chip exports to China.\n\nThe R1, an open-source model, surged to the top of Apple’s app store rankings this week, triggering a market sell-off. Shares of AI chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom plummeted by 17% on Monday, wiping out a combined $800 billion in market value. Nvidia has since recovered some of its losses.",

It might have been that his person gotten critical feedback why he/she hasn’t hired anyone yet, with that emotion read your referral and responded in his/her own emotion to your well-intended message. Sometimes the emotion you receive does not come from your message. I would, just like you mentioned here, want to have a chat with the person to understand. Maybe reach out in a few days when the height of emotions was worn off. By all means, your message is not wrong.",

Make your customer the hero, and show how you help them win.\n\n2️⃣ Show, Don’t Just Tell\n\nSaying “We provide the best service” is boring. Instead, tell a story: “Last week, a client came to us frustrated after wasting thousands on the wrong strategy.\n\nIn two weeks, we turned things around, and they finally saw real results.” Now, that’s powerful.\n\n3️⃣ Make It Personal\n\nPeople connect with people, not businesses. Share your struggles, your wins, your real journey. The more human your brand feels, the stronger the connection.\n\n P.S. I’ve built brands through storytelling for years, and trust me, this works. If you’re ready to build a brand people actually remember, DM me.",

He did something fascinating - demonstrated his exact door-to-door pitch from Vivint from 8 years ago, then broke down IBM's Global Sales School framework live on the show!\n\n\nKey takeaways from our chat:\n\n- Role-playing remains the #1 training method across organizations of all sizes\n- Why understanding buyer personas matter more than product pitches\n- How early-stage startups can learn from enterprise training programs (and vice versa)\n\n\nThe most fascinating part? Hearing Ryan literally reconstruct his sales evolution - from memorized scripts at Vivint to sophisticated frameworks at IBM. His example opening at IBM was gold: combining personal story (door-to-door experience) with business value to create instant credibility.\n\n\nIn the full episode, we covered:\n\n- Vivint's intensive door-to-door training program\n- IBM's legendary Global Sales School experience\n- The stark differences between startup vs enterprise sales training\n- Why understanding customer problems beats knowing product features\n- Key mistakes founders make when hiring their first sales rep\n\n\nOne of the most fun & tactical episodes I've recorded.\n\nCheck out the full conversation in the comments ",

The Referral Partner Who Sold Handbooks Using Our Name\n\nPicture this: a referral partner starts throwing our name around to sell handbooks.\n\nWhen I called them out, they hit me with, “Oh, that was a mistake.”\n\nSure, and I accidentally ate an entire cake last week. Then, because things weren’t weird enough, they tried to extort us for money to “fix it.”\n\nThe lesson?\n\nIf someone’s ethics are sketchy from the start, run. Integrity matters, and bad partners can tank your reputation faster than a bad Yelp review.\n\n2. The Competitor Who Wanted Us to Review Their Code\n\nA competitor came to us asking if we’d review their code to see if it “made sense.”\n\nTranslation: “Please do our homework for free.”\n\nThe lesson?\n\nIf someone’s offer sounds too one-sided, it’s because it is.\n\nPartnerships should be win-win, not win-“we take all your time and ideas.”\n\n3. The Client Who Took Our Advice, Left, and Then Came Crawling Back\n\nWe had a client who loved our advice. So much so, they took everything we created for them, jumped ship to another company, and used it all.\n\nThen, as if that wasn’t bold enough, they came back later asking us to help them sell their product.\n\nThe lesson?\n\nJust because you’re good at what you do doesn’t mean you have to help everyone.\n\nInvest your time in people who actually value your expertise—and aren’t going to ghost you like a bad date.\n\nHere’s the Deal:\n\nPartnerships are like relationships—they only work if there’s mutual respect, trust, and some semblance of common sense.\n\nShortcuts and shady moves might get quick wins, but they’ll burn out faster than my New Year’s resolutions.\n\nWhat’s the wildest partnership story you’ve experienced?\n\nLet’s hear it—I could use the laugh.",

It places a warning icon next to the cell and strikes through the outdated value. It’s a handy little reminder that says, “Hey, this data might not be accurate anymore”.\n\nFor businesses, this could be big. Whether you’re working on financial models, inventory tracking, or project timelines, you need your numbers to be spot-on. This feature could help you avoid expensive mistakes, making sure your team keep working with reliable data even in the most complex spreadsheets.\n\nIt should be available now in Microsoft 365. So keep an eye out for it.\n\nHow often do you double-check your spreadsheet values? Could this feature save you some headaches?",

I am very good at anticipating hypothetical problems and formulating solutions as well as finding ways to make small changes for large benefits even in areas where I don't have the technical expertise to implement them myself. I also have a lot of ideas that I would love to get developed, but I don't have an engineering degree. One of these ideas would prevent a backdraft in a structure fire. Several other ideas would combine green energy with emergency / disaster response and could be implemented at any scale ranging from a single structure up to a disaster affected region.",

Toss out trash, organize paperwork into piles, and put away stray objects. This makes it easier to clean surfaces properly without distractions.\n\n Tip 2: Start from the Top\nAlways clean from the top down—dust ceiling fans, shelves, and light fixtures first so debris falls to the floor. Then, move on to furniture and finish with vacuuming or mopping the floors. This method saves time by avoiding double work.\n\n Tip 3: Divide and Conquer\nBreak your cleaning into zones. For your desk, create separate areas for computer work and non-computer tasks. Use trays or containers to organize papers, pens, and miscellaneous items. In your home, tackle one room at a time for a more focused approach.\n\n Tip 4: Bundle Tasks with Daily Activities\nCombine cleaning with other routines to make it easier. For example, wipe down your bathroom sink after brushing your teeth or clean your kitchen counters while waiting for coffee to brew. Small tasks add up over time!\n\n Tip 5: Use the Right Tools\nInvest in microfiber cloths—they’re versatile and can clean almost any surface with just water or vinegar. Keep a small vacuum handy for quick cleanups of crumbs or pet hair in between deep cleans.\n\n Tip 6: Disinfect High-Touch Areas\nRegularly sanitize doorknobs, light switches, keyboards, and phones—especially in shared spaces like offices. Use disinfectant wipes or sprays to reduce germs and keep everyone healthy.\n\n Tip 7: Make Your Windows Shine\nUse a squeegee for streak-free windows and mirrors. Spray with a mix of water and dish soap, then wipe clean with the squeegee for a professional finish. Bonus: coffee filters also work great for spot-free glass!\n\n Tip 8: Stay on Top of Pet Hair\nIf you have pets, use a lint roller on furniture or rubber gloves to pick up hair easily. For carpets, a damp rubber squeegee works wonders before vacuuming to grab stubborn fur.\n\n Tip 9: Keep Cleaning Supplies Handy\nStore cleaning supplies in multiple areas of your home or office—like under sinks or in closets—so you can quickly grab what you need without hunting them down. Convenience is key!\n\n Tip 10: Set a Cleaning Schedule\nConsistency is everything! Create a weekly plan for tasks like vacuuming, dusting, and wiping surfaces. Daily habits like making your bed or tidying up after meals help maintain order without overwhelming deep-cleaning sessions later on.\n\n Follow me for more cleaning hacks!\n\n Share this post to help others keep their spaces spotless!",

        "content": "While online learning has revolutionized education, “providing access to millions of learners worldwide,” Mudit Goel, MS ’24, says it’s missing something critical: human connection.\n\nMore and more education is going digital. Goel notes that 60% of U.S. college students took at least one online course in 2021. But he sees a fundamental flaw in the current approach. \"You're all by yourself, lonely, confused, helpless,\" he says, describing the isolation many online learners face. With dropout rates between 40–80%, \"this cannot be the approach.\"\n\n\"Education is a great vehicle to bring people together,\" says Goel, who founded a coding school in India that has taught millions of students. Most people meet their closest friends through school or college, he notes, but online learning often fails to foster these crucial relationships. \"This is a huge missed opportunity, not just in terms of academics, but also human connections.\"\n\nThe solution, Goel believes, lies in making online learning more social and interactive, using technology like\nto facilitate group discussions and provide personalized feedback at scale. \"No matter how intelligent a machine becomes, it cannot replace human presence,\" he says, \"but it can help scale it,\" transforming a cold, lonely experience into something more connected and meaningful.\n\nThis video is from LOWkeynotes: Student presentations on ideas that change lives, organizations, and the world.",

How you treat others matters.\n\n\n2. Stay humble. Growth comes from learning.\n\n\n3. Communicate with empathy. Understand before reacting.\n\n\n4. Lead with integrity. Trust is earned, not given.\n\nWhat behavior do you think defines true success?",
