      "content": "One of the easiest ways to make more money as an employee: \nGo to your boss and ask for less money. \n\nHere's how it works.\n\nAny employee who can directly tie what they do to what the company makes can then make the following statement: \"Hey, instead of giving me a $100,000 base salary, I would like a $50,000 base salary. However, my bonus will be directly tied to the company's yearly success.\"\n\nThat way you are shifting the risk from the business owner to yourself. Whenever you take on more risk in life, you will be entitled to more reward.\n\nIF and only IF you know for a FACT that you are exceptional at what you do... ask to get paid less.",

You‚Äôre essentially saying, ‚ÄúBet on yourself, but only if you‚Äôre absolutely that person.‚Äù This flips the traditional employee mindset‚Äîmost people are running from risk, not toward it.\n\nBut let‚Äôs keep it real‚Äîthis strategy ain‚Äôt for everybody. You have to know your value, have receipts to back it up, and be in a role where your impact directly influences the company‚Äôs bottom line. Sales? Sure. Leadership? Maybe. Backend roles with no revenue tie? Not so much.\n\nIf you‚Äôve got the skill, the proof, and the guts to take on that risk, the upside could be major. But for most folks? Keep that base salary locked and work on climbing from there.",

I‚Äôve never understood ‚Äòmorning people‚Äô who jump out of bed ready for the day without the aid of 64 alarms and 74 cups of coffee. BUT I‚Äôve always said with truth in jest, if I were a morning person I‚Äôd be rich & skinny.\n\nAs it turns out, 2024 was the year that I made mornings happen in a profound way. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still LOVE sleep.\n\nAs I‚Äôve been scaling this business over the last 18+ months, I‚Äôve had a really, really hard time navigating somatic responses to extreme stress.\n\nIf you know me, you know that I GSD! Working SO hard over the past 20+ years to build other people‚Äôs organizations ‚Äî only in vain to lose my job to yet another RIF. But when I needed to put that same intensity into my own venture my body forced me to rest. And it's made me feel absolutely hopeless.\n\nWhen I lost my job in June 2023, I was still in the early stages of coming out of lifelong survival mode. Learning how-to-human at almost 40 presents a significant level of challenges, especially when you‚Äôre used to working beyond your capacity. Actually, I didn‚Äôt even know I had a capacity before 2022.; I thought I was a workhorse machine, only resting at the point of depletion.\n\nFinding balance in my life has been elusive, but I knew that I needed to get into a schedule to manage my migraines more effectively to achieve success/not lose my mind.\n\nIf I wanted different results, I must do the things I‚Äôve never done before.\n\nAnd so I began 7AM CrossFit. [6:30 AM a$$ in seat for a ride requires me to stop working before 3 AM - so it‚Äôs a win all around]\n\nIt took me from June until September to really get into a groove. In June I was still groggy & grumpy, but by September I was LOVING it, networking the F out of the morning, meeting more people before 8AM than most do all day.\n\nHealing is a just another word for finding new, healthy ways to solve for old problems. Trauma is just another word for extreme, overwhelming stress.\n\nLast Thursday, marked my mom‚Äôs 6 year death anniversary - a day that used to be a glaring reminder of loss has become a celebration of life & mind/ body/soul wellness that I work SO DANG hard to achieve er'day. I started 1/9 with 7AM CrossFit, recorded a podcast, promoted my affiliate partnerships, staying the course in her honor.\n\nI‚Äôve always been a sunset chaser, but now I live for the sunrises over the Hudson. Healing = Freedom‚Ñ¢Ô∏è from the lies we tell ourselves, a journey as brutal as it is beautiful.\n\nI ran into a friend I haven't seen in a while, after spending some time together, she said 'WOW, you really changed your WHOLE life!'\n\nAnd if I can do it, anyone can!\nHOW-ARE U HEALING‚Ñ¢Ô∏è",
