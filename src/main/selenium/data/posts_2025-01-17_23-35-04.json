      "content": "One of the easiest ways to make more money as an employee: \nGo to your boss and ask for less money. \n\nHere's how it works.\n\nAny employee who can directly tie what they do to what the company makes can then make the following statement: \"Hey, instead of giving me a $100,000 base salary, I would like a $50,000 base salary. However, my bonus will be directly tied to the company's yearly success.\"\n\nThat way you are shifting the risk from the business owner to yourself. Whenever you take on more risk in life, you will be entitled to more reward.\n\nIF and only IF you know for a FACT that you are exceptional at what you do... ask to get paid less.",

You’re essentially saying, “Bet on yourself, but only if you’re absolutely that person.” This flips the traditional employee mindset—most people are running from risk, not toward it.\n\nBut let’s keep it real—this strategy ain’t for everybody. You have to know your value, have receipts to back it up, and be in a role where your impact directly influences the company’s bottom line. Sales? Sure. Leadership? Maybe. Backend roles with no revenue tie? Not so much.\n\nIf you’ve got the skill, the proof, and the guts to take on that risk, the upside could be major. But for most folks? Keep that base salary locked and work on climbing from there.",

      "content": "Big deal about to close... but it’s not the ICP?\n\nWhen I work on refining sales strategies for scale ups, I always include a validation step.\n\nIt comes after the proposal and negotiation.\n\nIt’s an internal step for:\n– The CEO or VP of Sales to review the deal.\n– The SDR or sales manager to self-analyze.\n– An item to discuss during weekly or monthly deal reviews.\n\nThe key focus of validation?\n\nDouble-check the customer still fits your ICP.\n\nIt’s overlooked because:\n– The SDR wants to hit quota.\n– The sales manager wants to hit quota.\n– Or simply, the revenue is too tempting to resist.\n\nBut if you’re serious about scaling to 8 or 9 figures, you must take this step.\n\nYou must reconsider going ahead if the ICP isn’t the right fit.\n\nHere’s why…\n\nI recently read a story from Jake Fuentes, co-founder of Cascade, about why he shut his startup down.\n\nHe admitted that “ICP fray” was a key factor.\n\nCascade initially defined their ICP as “nontechnical business analysts using Excel to crunch big data sets”.\n\nThe definition was too broad.\n\nThey ended up chasing customers with wildly different use cases:\n– A scooter company managing location data.\n– An HR team managing employee data.\n\nThey didn’t have a framework to accept or reject opportunities, so they tried to support them all.\n\nJake described this as “a slow death of a thousand cuts.”\n\nSupporting anyone and everyone pulled the company in a million directions, ultimately diluting their focus and stunting growth.\n\nIf you want to scale successfully, rejecting deals from prospects who don’t fit your ICP is the tough but necessary way forward.\n\nValidate every deal.\n\nStick to your guns.\n\nKeep closing.\n\nLike what you read? ️ Repost it to your network and follow Steve Litzow for more.\n\nWant to accelerate your sales?

      "content": "Have you ever blown your own mind by doing the things that you never imagined were possible? \n\nThat is what it is like to be on a healing journey — there are myriad times in the day when I celebrate a Sic Parvis Magna Moment™️ (greatness from small beginnings) for myself, & illuminate them for others.\n\nI’ve been trying to make mornings happen since birth. I’ve never understood ‘morning people’ who jump out of bed ready for the day without the aid of 64 alarms and 74 cups of coffee. BUT I’ve always said with truth in jest, if I were a morning person I’d be rich & skinny.\n\nAs it turns out, 2024 was the year that I made mornings happen in a profound way. Don’t get me wrong, I still LOVE sleep.\n\nAs I’ve been scaling this business over the last 18+ months, I’ve had a really, really hard time navigating somatic responses to extreme stress.\n\nIf you know me, you know that I GSD! Working SO hard over the past 20+ years to build other people’s organizations — only in vain to lose my job to yet another RIF. But when I needed to put that same intensity into my own venture my body forced me to rest. And it's made me feel absolutely hopeless.\n\nWhen I lost my job in June 2023, I was still in the early stages of coming out of lifelong survival mode. Learning how-to-human at almost 40 presents a significant level of challenges, especially when you’re used to working beyond your capacity. Actually, I didn’t even know I had a capacity before 2022.; I thought I was a workhorse machine, only resting at the point of depletion.\n\nFinding balance in my life has been elusive, but I knew that I needed to get into a schedule to manage my migraines more effectively to achieve success/not lose my mind.\n\nIf I wanted different results, I must do the things I’ve never done before.\n\nAnd so I began 7AM CrossFit. [6:30 AM a$$ in seat for a ride requires me to stop working before 3 AM - so it’s a win all around]\n\nIt took me from June until September to really get into a groove. In June I was still groggy & grumpy, but by September I was LOVING it, networking the F out of the morning, meeting more people before 8AM than most do all day.\n\nHealing is a just another word for finding new, healthy ways to solve for old problems. Trauma is just another word for extreme, overwhelming stress.\n\nLast Thursday, marked my mom’s 6 year death anniversary - a day that used to be a glaring reminder of loss has become a celebration of life & mind/ body/soul wellness that I work SO DANG hard to achieve er'day. I started 1/9 with 7AM CrossFit, recorded a podcast, promoted my affiliate partnerships, staying the course in her honor.\n\nI’ve always been a sunset chaser, but now I live for the sunrises over the Hudson. Healing = Freedom™️ from the lies we tell ourselves, a journey as brutal as it is beautiful.\n\nI ran into a friend I haven't seen in a while, after spending some time together, she said 'WOW, you really changed your WHOLE life!'\n\nAnd if I can do it, anyone can!\nHOW-ARE U HEALING™️",
