      "content": "Ever wonder why some crush cold calling but others fail? \n\nIt's because of how interesting they are...\n\nEvery product falls on the innovation-commodity spectrum\n↳ your product's positioning (how the market sees it)\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗲𝘀: VERY interesting\n\nThese companies are obscure and their technology is often unknown.\n\nCold calling for them involves a lot of education.\n\nFor instance, when I worked with Stylo, we had a language model for customer support that auto-detected customer sentiment based on how the support ticket was written. No one had heard of it before.\n\nEvery call was about educating prospects. I would say, \"Imagine getting feedback on every customer interaction without sending surveys.\"\n\nThis approach makes cold calling easier because what you say is inherently 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴.\n\n\n2. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗲𝘀:\n\nThese companies compete primarily on price.\n\nTheir products are well-known and not much different from competitors.\n\nWhen cold calling for them, it's all about timing or a better price.\n\nYou ask, \"Is it the right time?\" or \"Would you consider a cheaper alternative?\"\n\nConsistency and good follow-up are key.\n\n\nUse this understanding-- where a product sits on this spectrum -- to tailor your script.\n\nFor innovative products, focus on education and showing the 10x value.\n\nFor commodities, focus on timing and cost-effectiveness.\n\nKnow your product.\nTailor your strategy.\n\nAchieve better results.",

Focus on: the feasibility, scalability, and potential production costs of your product.\n️ Without wanting to tout my own horn, partnering with an experienced team likemay be the best strategy to derisk your startup at this stage. Bringing in talent who has DONE the very thing you're trying to do before will be your best shot at minimizing technical risk.\n\n𝐒𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞: Navigating Market Validation and Early Adoption\nAt the seed stage the focus shifts to the market. Primary challenge: product-market fit. By understanding your potential customers, conducting market research, and collecting feedback from early adopters, you can validate your startup's business model and mitigate risks associated with market acceptance.\n\n𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐀: Scaling and Executing\nUpon securing Series A funding, it's time to scale. Risk: growth and lack of traction. Here, startups need to identify effective customer acquisition channels, streamline their marketing and sales strategies, and establish a scalable sales pipeline while maintaining service/product quality.\n\n𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐁: Expanding and Competing\nAt the Series B stage startups tend to enter new markets, expand geographically, or target new customer segments. As you spread your wings, you'll likely face increased competition and potential regulatory challenges. Challenge: balancing aggressive growth with maintaining operational efficiency to succeed at this stage.\n\n𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐂 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐁𝐞𝐲𝐨𝐧𝐝: Sustaining Culture and Scaling Operations\nWith Series C and beyond, the focus is on scaling operations on a larger scale and fostering a robust organizational culture.\n\nRemember, while these risks tend to fit each stage, the startup journey is rarely linear.\n\nThe No. 1 way to mitigate these risks (at any stage) = 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒄𝒄𝒆𝒔𝒔 𝒕𝒐 𝒕𝒂𝒍𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒘𝒉𝒐 𝒉𝒂𝒔 𝒈𝒐𝒏𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒈𝒉 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒋𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒚 𝒃𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆.\n\nYou don't want to work with a tech team who has never worked on a high-growth tech startup even if they are an excellent programmer.\n\n️ If you're a business founder looking to get an MVP built or hire a CTO DM me for info! Our team has built hundreds of MVPs over the years and we know how to scale ideas together.",

Imagine a few hours of uninterrupted calm, free from the constant ping of alerts—what would that feel like? This Saturday, I invite you to find out.\n\nWe live in a world where screens dominate our time, often at the expense of our mental and emotional well-being. Research shows that reducing screen time improves sleep, decreases stress, and even enhances our ability to focus. But stepping away isn’t always easy. Start small: try turning off notifications, leaving your phone in another room, or setting a “digital sunset” when you log off for the evening. Notice how your mind feels without the buzz of distractions.\n\nThis weekend, give yourself the gift of stillness. Replace scrolling with a mindful walk, reading a physical book, or simply savoring the quiet. Your leadership and well-being thrive when you take time to recharge. If you’re reading this on a Saturday or Sunday, consider it your reminder to log off and reconnect with yourself. How will you spend your screen-free time today?\n\nHi, I'm Edward Schaefer, a leadership coach focused on leadership, culture, strategy, systems, and change. I believe that effective leadership starts with a healthy, well-rested mind and a heart that's connected to what matters most.\nThis post is part of my\nseries—a collection designed to help you pause, reflect, and recharge. If you found this helpful, please like, comment, or share it with others who might benefit from a reminder to rest and care for themselves. Follow me for more insights on leadership and well-being, and if you'd like to explore coaching together, reach out—I'm here to support your growth, both as a leader and as a person.",
