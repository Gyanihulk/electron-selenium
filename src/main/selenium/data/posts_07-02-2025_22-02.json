        "content": "Your forecasts are as accurate as a weather map in a hurricane.\n\nFounders love dashboards—until they realize they’re just colorful spreadsheets filled with bad decisions.\nIf you're still obsessing over \"win rates\" and \"pipeline velocity,\" congrats—you’ve mastered the art of looking busy while staying blind.\n\nForget those vanity metrics—these are the RevOps numbers that actually keep your business alive:-\n\n Sales Cycle Compression Rate – Closing deals is great. But are you closing them faster over time? If not, your sales efficiency is breaking, not scaling.\n\n Rep-Specific Deal Slippage – If one rep always has deals “pushed to next quarter,” they’re not closing—they’re collecting excuses.\n\n Pricing Deviation Index (PDI) – You say “premium pricing,” but your deals keep closing at a 40% discount. That’s not premium, that’s a clearance sale.\n\n Lead-to-Customer CAC Payback – Some lead sources look profitable—until you realize they take forever to pay back CAC. Congrats, you just paid to lose money.\n\n Ghost Pipeline Ratio – Deals in late stages that magically disappear without being marked lost? That’s not a sales pipeline. That’s a fantasy novel.\n\n Sales Efficiency Decay Rate – If every new rep is less efficient than the last, your onboarding is a disaster, not a process.\n\n Rep Ramp Time vs. First Dollar Closed – Time to quota is nice, but how fast can a new rep close anything? That’s your real onboarding health check.\n\n Proposal-to-Close Ratio – If your reps are sending out 10 proposals to close 1 deal, they’re not selling. They’re just emailing PDFs into the void.\n\n Renewal Expansion vs. Shrinkage Velocity – If your customers shrink faster than they expand, your revenue is on life support. Fix your onboarding and retention.\n\n⏳ Time-to-Forecast Accuracy – If your forecast only becomes accurate in the last two weeks of the quarter, you don’t have a forecast. You have wishful thinking.\n\nMost RevOps reports are just storytelling with numbers. The real question is: Are your numbers telling the right story?\n\nThat’s where Clientell comes in.\n\nOur AI doesn’t just track these metrics—it fixes them before they become a problem.\n Deals dragging? We find and eliminate bottlenecks in your sales cycle.\n Reps sandbagging? Our AI flags deal slippage before it happens.\n Discounting out of control? We tell you exactly where pricing leaks are.\n Forecasting still a guessing game? We replace gut feelings with real pipeline intelligence.\n\nFounders don’t need more dashboards. They need ANSWERS.\n\nWant to set these up in your Salesforce? Or need a ready-to-use template to get started? Drop a comment, and I’ll send it your way!\n\nWhat’s the dumbest sales metric you’ve seen?",

Leading up to this week, I was running on fumes , staring down an impossible to-do list, and (if I’m really keeping it real) kind of dreading the trip to New Orleans.\n\nBut then I remembered something a former coworker once told me:\n\n \"I don’t ‘have’ to do things. I ‘get’ to do things.\" \n\nAnd that small shift in mindset changed everything.\n\nBecause THIS week? I got to be up close with the Super Bowl teams , soaking in the energy, the excitement, and the absolute spectacle of it all. I got to experience moments that make me stop and think, Is this real life? Is this actually a day’s work? \n\nPretty blessed. Pretty grateful. And yes, pretty hyped.  More footage to come! ",

You've reached out to three different contractors for quotes, but days go by, there’s silence, missed follow-ups, and endless back-and-forth that leaves you questioning if anyone even wants your business. Sound familiar? This frustrating experience was overwhelming, I ended up sleeping in the walk-in closet for weeks. It made me realize how urgent the need for better customer experience (\n) in the home services industry.\n\nRecent research byXM Institute shows that 51% of consumers stop spending with a brand after a negative experience. This behavior risks a staggering $3.7 trillion annually for companies worldwide. It is proof that high-quality CX is more important than ever.\n\nSo, how can businesses change this narrative? I recently had an opportunity to collaborate withand explore their AI agents. And here's how they're transforming customer experience (CX):\n Intelligent Routing: No more getting stuck in endless chatbot loops like I did when trying to schedule my roller shade installation. AI can understand complex requests and quickly direct you to a human agent when needed.\n Omnichannel Support: Whether you're reaching out by phone, chatting online, or speaking in person, AI ensures a seamless experience across all channels, so you don't have to repeat your story about the shades.\n Multilingual Support: Language barriers are a thing of the past with Regal's AI agents. They communicate fluently in multiple languages, allowing businesses to scale globally and provide seamless support to customers worldwide\n Unified Customer View: Agents can access your entire order history, preferences, and more, even if you don't have your tracking number on hand, making it easy to get updates about your roller shade installation.\n Proactive Support: Imagine getting timely updates about your installation schedule or any potential delays, without needing to chase down answers.\n Personalized Experience: AI tailors every interaction based on the urgency of your request, whether it's about a last-minute installation or a follow-up question about your shades, ensuring you get focused and relevant assistance.\n\nThe future of CX is about creating meaningful, seamless interactions.

But Microsoft has decided it’s time for a change.\n\nThe feature’s being phased out, possibly because not many people used it. But of course, there’s something else on the way (for some people anyway).\n\nMicrosoft is rolling out a replacement called ‘Click to Do,’ an AI-powered tool that takes suggestions to the next level. It’ll offer smarter, context-based actions to help streamline tasks.\n\nThe catch? It’s only available on newer Copilot+ PCs with the hardware needed to support advanced AI features.\n\nUnfortunately, older devices will just lose the “suggested actions” menu without a replacement.\n\nIf you’ll miss this feature, you can let Microsoft know through the Feedback Hub app. For most people though, this change might pass by unnoticed.\n\nWhat do you think... will you miss “suggested actions,”? Or are you ready to embrace AI-powered tools like ‘Click to Do’?",

        "content": "7 Sales Secrets They Don’t Want You to Know (But Your Prospects Will Love) \nWant to close deals like a Jedi Master? Ditch the outdated playbook.\n\nHere’s the unfiltered truth about modern sales (that actually works):\n\n1. Reverse Psychology 101: Ask for a “No” to Get a “Yes”\nBad: “Would you like a demo?”\nGenius: “Would it be a horrible idea to show you how this works in 90 seconds?”\n\nProspects love feeling in control. Let them say “no” to the wrong thing so they say “yes” to the right one.\n\n2. Steal This Line: “What Would Happen If…”\nDrop this bomb: “What do you think would happen if you solved [X problem] tomorrow?”\nSuddenly, they’re pitching themselves on your solution. You? Just smile and take notes.\n\n3. Master the Art of Time Respect (Even If You’re Lying)\nStart cold calls with: “I’ll keep this quick—promise.”\nThen hit them with a 30-second story so compelling they’ll ask to keep talking.\n\n4. Future-Proof Your Pipeline: Turn “No” Into “Not Yet”\nWhen they say “Call me next quarter,” reply: “Totally get it! What’s one thing that would make this a slam dunk in 90 days?”\nNow they’re scripting your follow-up email. Checkmate.\n\n5. Strategic Silence (Then Strike)\nNod. Pause. Let them talk. Then hit ’em with: “It sounds like [pain they didn’t mention] is killing you.”\nWait for the nervous laugh.  Now they think you’re a mind reader.\n\n6. Sell the Vision. Let Support Clean Up the Mess.\n“Does it integrate with your current tools? Absolutely.” (Cue frantic Slack to engineering post-sale.)\nClose first, apologize never.\n\n7. The Magic Phrase: “Just Out of Curiosity…”\nSprinkle this in: “Just out of curiosity… how are you handling [pain point] right now?”\nTranslation: “Let me expose the gap in your process so you beg me to fix it.”\n\nBONUS RULE: If you’re not getting ghosted, you’re not pushing hard enough.\nAgree?",

The reps who consistently overachieve are the ones who identify and eliminate productivity gaps before they snowball into missed targets\n\nHere’s what I mean: If the goal is $500K in closed deals this quarter, do you know how much time it takes to generate $10K in pipeline or just move a deal from proposal to close?\n\nProductivity isn’t just about hitting numbers but building a process that consistently drives better outcomes\n\nHere’s how to break it down:\n\n\nStep 1: Understand your productivity metrics\n\nIt might sound boring but this is where real growth happens. Start with something like this: if it takes you 4 hours to generate $10K in pipeline, ask: How can I get 5% or 10% faster?\n\nStep 2: Use technology to increase output without burning yourself out\n\nAI-powered tools can track which stages of your deals take the longest, pinpoint where leads drop off, and even suggest the best times to engage prospects based on past performance\n\n\nThe reps winning right now are building systems for tracking every step so they can make quick adjustments, turning small productivity gains into big wins\n\nChasing the quota is short-term thinking. Dial in on optimizing the process and watch how it transforms your results\n\nCheck out the full breakdown in Monday’s episode of The Innovative Seller",

Years ago I said: \"In my lifetime the most profound conversations I will have will be with AI\" then LLMs came around, not so crazy now.\n\nMonths back I said generative AI is showing signs of ray tracing... not so crazy now.\n\nIn the next two years the entire python kernel will have been absorbed 100% into LLMs, meaning you will have perfect anticipation of code outputs. No need to debug anymore, this will lead to a pace of innovation we can't imagine today.\n\nIn the next 5-10 years we will be able to cure every autoimmune disease thanks to AI because our knowledge of biological interactions on the human body will be reaching a level of perfection we didn't think possible. AI might be able to finally cure to cancer we've all been promised for decades.\n\nWhat are your crazy predictions in the next 5-10 years with AI where some people might think you're crazy, but there is a chance you will be right.",

        "content": "Growing up the biggest barrier to using computers for me was understanding what they wanted; said another way, it was always difficult to tell when something was going wrong.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize that my frustration with the tool was misplaced, a computer doesn't actually want anything, it's me who's using it because I want something. When a computer showed me something I didn't like not only would I need to know exactly where my input was wrong, but also know where the computer thought my input was wrong. I needed to know how I was wrong. That's unfair - I'm not a computer and I shouldn't have to think like one! Thankfully we recognized the interaction model with computers was poor and this frustration was a symbol of the mismatch between a computers expectations of my knowledge (really their designers) and my intentions as a human. This gap in understanding is why I think I chose to pursue a career in design.\n\nWhile the time to a response has gotten shorter and shorter since I first used a computer, the distance between my desired outcome and my starting point has always maintained a great length. Right now, my younger self is feeling that distance closing at a more rapid rate. My ability to get what I want from a computer is now determined by two things: my patience and my ability to specifically articulate what I want, a skill nearly anyone in the world can learn. My inner child would have loved to be using a computer for the first time today and I think the computer that helps close that gap even faster is still being designed.\n\n's article here highlights the enormous opportunity us designers have to capture this new way of interacting with computers. I too hope we don't constrain ourselves to a chat box.",

        "content": "JavaScript Frameworks vs. Other Programming Language Frameworks – Which One Reigns Supreme?\n\nChoosing the right framework is crucial for any developer. While JavaScript frameworks dominate web development, other programming languages like Python, Java, and PHP offer powerful alternatives. Here’s a detailed comparison of both:\n\n1️⃣ Performance & Speed\n\nJavaScript Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js) are optimized for high-speed frontend interactions, making web apps smooth and dynamic. With server-side options like Node.js, JavaScript can also handle backend processes efficiently.\n\nOther Language Frameworks (Django, Spring, Laravel) often prioritize security and complex backend operations over sheer speed. While great for handling large-scale applications, they may lag in rendering dynamic user interfaces.\n\n\n🟢 Best For: JavaScript in real-time apps (e.g., chats, dashboards), while Python/Java is better for computation-heavy applications.\n\n2️⃣ Scalability & Ecosystem\n\nJavaScript Frameworks benefit from an extensive ecosystem with packages (NPM) and integrations, making it easy to scale and extend applications.\n\nOther Frameworks like Spring (Java) or Django (Python) provide robust backend scaling but may require additional frontend solutions like React or Vue.\n\n\n🟢 Best For: JavaScript is the leader for full-stack scalability, while backend-heavy projects may lean toward Java/Python.\n\n3️⃣ Ease of Learning & Development Speed\n\nJavaScript Frameworks focus on flexibility and quick iteration, allowing rapid prototyping with minimal setup.\n\nOther Frameworks like Laravel (PHP) and Django (Python) simplify backend logic but may require additional learning for frontend compatibility.\n\n\n🟢 Best For: JavaScript frameworks for fast development cycles; Python/Laravel for structured backend logic.\n\n4️⃣ Community & Support\n\nJavaScript has one of the largest developer communities, with active support for React, Angular, and Node.js.\n\nOther frameworks like Django, Flask, and Laravel also have strong communities, but JavaScript’s front-end-first approach makes it more accessible for beginners.\n\n\n🟢 Best For: JavaScript leads in open-source contributions and real-time issue resolution.\n\n5️⃣ Versatility & Use Cases\n\nJavaScript (React, Vue, Angular) dominates web UI/UX, mobile apps (React Native), and even server-side (Node.js).\n\nOther frameworks shine in domains like AI/ML (Python), enterprise solutions (Java), and content-heavy websites (PHP/Laravel).\n\n\n🟢 Best For: JavaScript in web & hybrid apps; Python/Java in AI and enterprise apps.\n\n Conclusion:\n\nJavaScript frameworks excel in speed, versatility, and full-stack development, making them ideal for modern web applications. Other programming languages bring power to backend-heavy and AI-driven applications. Your choice depends on the project needs and scalability goals!",

The response was completely different.\n\nNot only did people resonate with my opinion, but they also found value in it.\n\nI shared my experience working with different Founders, CEOs, and Entrepreneurs on how they view LinkedIn engagement metrics and define success.\n\nWhile 85% of creators call them vanity metrics, I’ve seen firsthand how strategic engagement drives visibility, credibility, collaboration, and business opportunities for top executives.\n\nIt wasn’t easy to go against the grain, but authenticity matters. People learn, perspectives shift, and conversations evolve when we share what we know works.\n\nWhat if I didn't share that content \n\nHERE ARE THINGS I LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE;\n\n Fear is often unfounded – The content we hesitate to post might be the one that resonates the most.\n\n Authenticity wins – Sharing unique perspectives, even if unpopular, builds credibility and sparks meaningful conversations.\n\n Engagement isn’t just vanity – When done strategically, it drives visibility, authority, and real business opportunities.\n\n You never know until you try – Holding back your voice means missing out on opportunity/impact; put your insights out there.\n\nSEE YOU AT THE TOP \n___________________________\n\nP.S.

Their reports were always a day late, and by the time they reacted, customers had already walked away.\n\nWe switched them to real-time analytics, and the transformation was instant. They could track demand shifts as they happened, tweak pricing dynamically, and optimize stock levels in the moment.\n\nResult? 20% fewer stockouts, higher sales, and less waste.\n\nThis isn’t just a retail thing. Every industry today needs to move at the speed of NOW.\n\nBanks need to stop fraud before it happens—not after the damage is done.\nMarketers need to adjust campaigns on the fly—not post-mortem.\nManufacturers need instant supply chain insights—not crisis reports.\n\nReal-time data isn’t a luxury anymore—it’s the difference between leading the game and playing catch-up.\n\nIs your business still running on yesterday’s data? Let’s talk about it!",

Inconsistent sales, frustrated teams, and stalled growth.\n\nThe good news? This isn’t a sales problem—it’s a system problem.\n\nHere's the 6 Pillars of a Scalable Sales System:\n\n1️⃣ Clear Offer Positioning – If you can’t explain your value, don’t expect reps to.\n2️⃣ Defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) – Selling to everyone = selling to no one.\n3️⃣ A Repeatable Sales Process – Every rep follows the same proven framework.\n4️⃣ Lead Generation & Outreach Strategy – Where do leads come from? How do you engage them?\n5️⃣ Tracking & Optimization – What gets measured gets improved—data fuels growth.\n6️⃣ Sales Automation & Tech Stack – Your sales machine should work 24/7, even when you’re not.\n\nThe best sales people don’t just work hard—they work within a system that’s built for success.\n\nFix the system first—then scale.",

        "content": "Your prospect loves your solution—but that doesn’t mean they’ll buy it. Here’s why.\n\nMost sales training focuses on two core skills:\n\n1. Qualifying for fit and need\n2. Positioning your solution in a compelling way.\n\nAnd that’s all important.\n\nBut does that sound like enough to you?\n\nIt shouldn't.\n\nThere’s something missing.\n\nYou become aware of this when you think you’ve done everything right. You qualified the prospect, ran a killer demo, handled objections, and even got a verbal yes.\n\nThen they go with someone else.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt has nothing to do with you, your pitch, or your product.\n\nIt’s about the internal boxes the prospect needs to check before they can buy.\n\nThey fall into 4 categories:\n\n1. Decision Criteria\n– What are the key factors influencing their decision?\n– Is cost the main driver, or are they prioritizing functionality, support, or scalability?\n\n2. Decision Process\n– What’s their usual path to purchasing a solution like yours?\n– Who needs to be involved?\n– Are there approvals or legal reviews that could slow things down?\n\n3. Decision Timeline\n– Is there a deadline or compelling event pushing this forward?\n– Can you work together to create a business case and gain mid-cycle approval?\n\n4. Budget and Source of Funds\n– Do they have executive buy-in, or will they need help securing it?\n– Is there a budget already set aside, or do they need to justify the spend?\n– What does their procurement process look like?\n\nThese 4 categories are often called BANT—Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline.\n\nIf you aren’t testing for them throughout the sales cycle, you’re leaving too much to chance.\n\nBecause even if they love your solution, even if they need it…\n\nIf they can’t check these boxes, the deal won’t close.\n\nTrain your team to sell with this in mind.\n\nKeep closing.\n\nLike what you read? ️ Repost it to your network and follow Steve Litzow for more.\n\nWant to accelerate your sales?

        "content": "BIOMIMICRY CONTINUUM – Part 4 – Update Agent LEARNING\nFundamental evidence of learning is the ability to recall and utilize what is learned. Receiving and integrating new information is a starting point. It is not learning, but an exceedingly small subset.\nRecent research published in Nature uncovered that Concept Cells help our brain abstract information and build memories. (,)\n\nA report in Quanta magazine () provides an example: The idea of a “bank” has its own set of concept cells, maybe millions of them. Concept neurons fire for their concept no matter how it is presented: in real life or a photo, in text or speech, on television or in a podcast. “It’s more abstract, really different from what you’re seeing,” said Elizabeth Buffalo, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington.\n\nThese discoveries support and align with the abstraction methodology discussed in Part 2 and the contextualization methodology in Part 3.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to how the brain learns, LLMs:\n-process all ingested data rather than filtering for relevance, and\n-output the detailed words and pixels based on statistical proximity rather than conceptual value\nThe aim is to pass the Turing test, output that imitates the appearance of intelligence sufficiently to deceive the user.\n\nThe correctness of the result is dependent on the concentrations of relevant data in the training content. AI speed hides the fact that the model does not “know” anything but rather recomputes even identical prompts.\n\nOn the other hand, by imitating the learning and memory architecture and methodology of the brain the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem creates a library of reusable expertise and continues to learn. Imagine the applications when expertise is in high demand but sparse due to \"brain drain\" scenarios, new science and technology, or economic constraints.\n\nIn part 5 I will discuss the curation methodology.",

No pretense, no ego - just a genuine conversation about the future. It’s a reminder that great leaders don’t need to be distant or intimidating.\n\n•AI Insights\nReid is deeply invested in understanding how AI will reshape business and society.\n\nA few key takeaways from the video:\n\n- AI will act as a “co-pilot” for professionals, enhancing creativity and decision-making.\n- It’s not about replacing humans but “amplifying human potential” - think of it as a tool to solve problems faster and smarter.\n- The risks are real, but so are the opportunities. We need to design AI systems that “keep humanity connected”, not isolated.\n\n•Staying Ahead of Trends\nReid’s ability to stay updated with the latest trends, from AI to social media, is a lesson for all leaders. He doesn’t just talk about the future - he’s actively shaping it.\n\nHis approach is a blueprint for modern leadership - grounded, forward-thinking, and deeply human.\n\nLeaders, take note.\n\nFollow for more\n\nCredits: TikTok/@TedZhar",

It changed everything.\n\n\nSee, I'm the type who wants to do everything:\n\n• Launch a YouTube channel\n• Build multiple products\n• Speak at conferences\n• Create online courses\n• Start a podcast\n• Write a book\n\nBut with a 2.5-year-old toddler and family commitments, that's a recipe for disaster.\n\nSo, I flipped the script.\n\nBefore I started my business,, 4 months ago, I created a \"Must Not Do\" list for year one:\n\n1. No long-form YouTube videos\n2. No hiring full-time employees\n3. No launching another course\n4. No spreading myself too thin\n5. No video podcast\n\nThe result?\n\nClarity. Focus. Peace.\n\nAnti-goals aren't about limiting yourself.\n\nThey're about protecting your most valuable resources:\n• Your time\n• Your energy\n• Your family moments\n\nAt this stage in my career, those are the things that matter most.\n\nHere's the truth:\n\nYou can do anything, but not everything at once.\n\nSometimes, the path to success isn't about what you do.\n\nIt's about what you consciously choose not to do.\n\nWhat's on your anti-goals list for 2025?",

        "content": "GTM executive terminated after 10 months of employment and witnessing and experiencing systemic sexism and discrimination. \n\nOffered only 1 week of severance and partial bonus. This is after delivering on all her goals and meeting all KPIs. During her tenure, she received nothing but praise from her manager.\n\nAnother one of many victims of the systemic and blatant discrimination against women in the company.\n\nI consulted with an extremely impressive customer support leader named Jenna. Despite receiving nothing but praise throughout her tenure, she was terminated just 4 weeks after the arrival of a new boss.\n\nDuring those 4 weeks, the new boss did everything in his power to make Jenna miserable and drive her out of the company.\n\nHe made changes to her role, publicly humiliated her, alienated her team against her, questioned her value and contributions, and suggested she should resign.\n\nIn addition, he questioned Jenna about her age and made frequent comments about her appearance and protective motherly tendencies.\n\nJenna like many women in the organization were regularly dismissed and treated in a disrespectful manner. As the highest-ranking female on the executive team, many female employees regularly came to Jenna in confidence sharing stories of bias and discrimination.\n\nJenna brought these concerns to human resources including her observations that only 1 female was hired out of the last 17 new hires announced by the company. Women were often given administrative tasks regardless of their seniority, where men were not.\n\nEvery single woman in leadership was either demoted, resigned or managed out. Sharon was the last one standing.\n\nJenna was terminated with no complaints of performance, no PIP, no warning, just told they were going in a different direction and her position was eliminated.  Jenna was offered only 1 week of severance and most of her quarterly bonus.\n\nA few weeks later, Jenna’s manager hired a former colleague of hers from a prior company to take Jenna’s eliminated position.\n\nJenna reached out and worked with us to put together a counter response to their wrongful termination and pathetic severance offer. We put together a scathing document laying out a compelling case.\n\nAfter 2 weeks of negotiations, the employer agreed and increased their offer from 1 week of severance or $4,250 to 20 weeks or $90,500, a 1900% increase from the initial offer.\n\nIn addition, Jenna got 6 months of COBRA paid out as a lump sum and grossed up for taxes and the remaining of her bonus that was not originally offered.\n\nOverall, we helped Jenna increase her offer by more than $100k as she realized an ROI of 6778% on her initial investment with us.\n\nThe outcome was beyond her wildest expectations, and she is thrilled to have come across us on LinkedIn.\n\nEvery severance offer should be negotiated.",

All the anti-DEI folks know is they're supposed to hate DEI.\n\nWell I hate to break it to you, but if you oppose DEI, you are literally opposing efforts to include, serve, and accommodate America's diverse populations.\n\nWhen the US experienced a powerful, yet brief racial awakening after George Floyd's death, racist white men gaslit the public into thinking they were the new oppressed minority. And it worked. Many women and people of color bought this narrative, not realizing they were harming themselves in the process.\n\nAnd other vulnerable populations including but not limited to: veterans, persons with disabilities, and religious minorities.\n\nWe need to let go of the DEI is anti-white narrative. There is room for everyone at the table. Problem is, there are folks who don't WANT everyone at the table.

Every day a donor remains unengaged decreases the likelihood of further contributions, significantly reducing their lifetime value.\n\nWe all get dazzled by the allure of new prospects. But what about the donors already on board?\n\nPrompt and thoughtful engagement can turn a new donor into a lifelong supporter. A donor who feels valued and sees the impact of their contribution is far more likely to deepen their commitment.\n\nEffective donor management isn't just good manners; it's a strategic imperative. It builds a community of supporters who aren't just contributors but are true partners in your mission.\n\nOur study of 126,000 first-time donors underscores this: Fast, regular, and highly personal acknowledgments, immediately followed by the next ask, radically improve both donor retention and lifetime value.\n\n𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠-𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦 𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐬?",
