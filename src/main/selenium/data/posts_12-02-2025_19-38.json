        "content": "Most manufacturers are using Salesforce completely wrong. \n\nThey invest thousands into it, expecting sales teams to magically become more productive… and instead, reps spend more time updating Salesforce than actually selling.\n\nIt’s no wonder salespeople have started calling it “Spreadsheet 2.0.”\nSo, what’s going wrong? A lot. But here are the biggest issues—and how to fix them:\n\n 1. Your CRM shouldn’t be a time-sucking black hole.\nMost CRMs are just cluttered with outdated deals, duplicate contacts, and “90% likely to close” opportunities… from three years ago. Reps don’t trust the data because updating Salesforce feels like more work than closing the deal itself.\n\n 2. Distributors aren’t updating your CRM—stop expecting them to.\nManufacturers love assuming distributors will track deals in Salesforce like an in-house sales team. They won’t. They never will.\n\n 3. Forecasting shouldn’t feel like a voodoo ritual.\nIf your sales forecasting is just people guessing numbers leadership wants to hear, you’re basically flipping a coin.\n\n 4. If quoting still takes days, you’re losing deals.\nA shocking number of manufacturers still use manual quoting, spreadsheets, and price lists from 2019. If your customers have to wait days for a quote, guess what? They’re already talking to your competitors.\n\n 5. Salesforce isn’t a sales strategy.\nIf your sales process is broken—chasing low-intent leads, manually handling repeat orders, relying on email for pricing—Salesforce won’t magically fix it. It’s just a tool.\n\n Bottom line? Salesforce can be a game-changer—but only if you actually build a sales process that works. Otherwise, you’re just throwing money at an overpriced to-do list.\n\nWhat’s your biggest Salesforce frustration? Drop a comment or shoot me a message—I promise you’re not the only one dealing with this!",

The best ideas win, the strongest performers move up, and those who embrace accountability excel.\n\nSo, be honest—are you in a system that rewards results?

Though this isn't where you were going, the only problem, as I see it, with the current shift to hiring and promoting exclusively by merit is that we don't know who's defining merit...\n\nDoes merit mean you work the hardest? That you have the best ideas? That you're the CEO's nephew? Until you know the answer to that question, merit is a game of hit and miss. It's on leaders to clearly define the rules of the game and then live by them.",

Reframe failure so that every setback is set up.\n \"I’m afraid of making mistakes.\"\n \"Mistakes are proof I’m learning.\"\n\n2. Reframe pressure so high stakes can lead to high growth.\n \"I can’t handle this pressure.\"\n \"I perform well under pressure because I prepare.\"\n\n3. Reframe challenges as opportunities.\n \"This is too hard.\"\n \"This is a challenge I can figure out.\"\n\n4. Reframe discipline as the key to success.\n \"I don’t feel like doing it.\"\n \"I do what’s necessary, not just what’s easy.\"\n\n5. Reframe time and prioritise.\n \"I don’t have enough time.\"\n \"I make time for what matters most.\"\n\n6. Reframe success as a habit.\n \"I hope this works out.\"\n \"I’ll make this work through action and persistence.\"\n\n7. Reframe opportunities as action steps.\n \"I’ll wait for the right time.\"\n \"The best time to start is now.\"\n\nWhen you change your approach, you change your worldview.\n\nThis starts with how you choose to speak to yourself.\n\nSeeing the bigger picture is a good exercise,\nBut reframing it is where real growth happens.\n\nWhich reframe is your favourite?\nLet me know below ⬇️\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nIf you liked this post, you may like my newsletter: The Growth Mindset.\n\n\n\nRepost this to help your network & follow mefor more content like this.",

This means customers have solar equipment on their home they can't use.\n\nThe loan companies are not paying the solar companies all of their commissions meaning solar companies literally have hundreds of thousands up to millions of unclaimed money!\n\nThis has been an ongoing industry issue for 5+ years it's nothing new anybody who's worked anywhere in solar for a week knows this.\n\nThere are tons of meetings on how to schedule more efficiently, and get more accounts fully installed.\n\nTHE REALITY.\n\nYou need more electricians in the field. Just a fact. You need electricians to go button up the homes and fix electrical fixes and just do things at homes that need to be done to satisfy customers!\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nSolar companies don't want to pay electricians. They are the most expensive field cost.\n\nThere is a never ending cycle for solar companies. They need corporate people to answer the phone of angry customers.\n\nSo they hire more people for the phones.\n\nTaking the budget away from hiring the solution to the actual problem so no electricians are hired!\n\nKeeping you in the death loop of not being able to collect the rest of your money, and having angry customers.\n\nTHE LOOP\n\nExecutive says go collect the M3 payments\n\"were are sitting on hundreds of thousands we need to collect in Q4\"\n\nManagers say ok we can do but it takes our electricians away from installs\n\"can we hire an electrician\"\nExecutive\n\"yea after we collect the M3 payments we'll have the budget for it.\"\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nTake money from corporate ops team, put it into the field!\n\nWhat's the first area you can cut without losing produciton?\n\nYou can't cut cad, permitting or PTO processors then the business doesn't move.\n\nSo you cut customer support and then you anger everyone of your customers. Then your reps complain and everything is downhill from there.\n\nUSE AI SUPPORT AGENTS!\n\nYou won't believe how good they are\nThey are way cheaper than you think\nThey can handle any conversation YES CONVERSATION you need.\n\nComment AGENT lets turn your company around!",

Allyship arrived with \"hopes and prayers\" that people with influence would finally do what they should have been doing the whole time instead of condoning/giggling at inappropriate statements/acts in private corners or the office ; that allows others to get run over (historically marginalized or low priveledge/power).\n\nIn workplaces where the Power Distance is wide, this becomes more important. The unfortunate thing is that LinkedIn posts have become the new 10 in 1 poster of the age; they were on the breakroom walls that people see (in a highly visible place), but they don't move it off the wall/out of orientation and toward standing in the gap for those being harmed.\n\nThis becomes normalized, suppressed and the wounded (those who can afford it) just go away. Without co-conspirators (not a cute ally) to hold up justice, psych safety and wellness, you will just have smiling allies who will just \"LIKE\" a post ...feel good about themselves....and then keep moving; instead of seeing posts like this as a coaching mirror to self reflect, \"How am I contributing to this and what must I do differently\".\n",

        "content": "Have you ever tried to start a fire in the rain while camping?\n\nWhen I was ten, I had this grand vision of being the kind of kid who could survive in the wild. My hippie mother loved living off the land, being with nature, and cooking over an open flame.\n\nI had watched her countless times—crouched over a tiny pile of sticks, lighting her Bic lighter until, like magic, flames appeared.\n\nI was ready to try it on my own.\n\nOf course, at age ten, your brain doesn't consider that rain might impact your mission.\n\nI had damp twigs, a matchbook I stole from her friend's pack of Marlborough Light cigarettes, and the unshakable confidence of a child who had seen something done but never done it themselves.\n\nI stacked everything into what I thought looked like a proper fire, struck a match, and watched it hiss out instantly.\n\nTried again. Same thing.\n\nBy the fifth match, frustration turned into desperation. I crouched there, flicking match after match, expecting some grand eruption of flames, but all I got was wet smoke and the realization that I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nThen, my mom joined me. She saw the mess I was making—the scattered burnt-out matches, the sad little pile of damp sticks. And, instead of laughing, she knelt beside me and said:\n\n\"You're trying to start a bonfire before you've got an ember.\"\n\nThen she showed me.\n\nA single dry leaf. One match. Let it catch. Protect it. Feed it gently.\n\nWithin minutes, that one tiny ember turned into a small flame. The twigs caught, and the fire grew.\n\nAnd I'll never forget what she said next:\n\n\"The trick isn't making fire. It's keeping it alive.\"\n\nDecades later, I've realized that this is exactly how consistency works for entrepreneurs trying to build a business on their own.\n\nMost creative entrepreneurs think they need to come out swinging—posting daily, executing flawlessly, and running at full speed from the start. But that's like striking match after match without giving the fire a chance to catch.\n\nIt doesn't work.\n\nRead more in the Weekly MindSweep No. 161 | Mind Your Business |\n\n\n",

You care about them, but knowing when and how to step in to help them get more value can feel like guesswork. That’s where customer health scores come in.\n\nYou can calculate customer health scores (similar to product engagement scores) with product data and a spreadsheet if you want.\n\nOr you can build them in Accoil\n\nHealth scores show you who’s thriving, who ain't. If you build the scoring right, early warning signs like a drop in activity or unexpected data exports start to show up in your scores.\n\nHealthy customers have healthy scores. Unhealthy customers may slowly drop off or maybe they'll fall off a cliff. If your role and maybe your compensation is based on keeping more customers longer AND you're not tracking customer health scores over time, you're missing a big opportunity.",

The real issue is that most media houses, across all categories, resist acknowledging this reality and making necessary changes. But this isn’t limited to media alone. Whether it’s car manufacturers, luggage brands, or even TV and refrigerator companies—every industry follows the same playbook. If you raise a complaint, their immediate defense is: “But the competition isn’t doing it either, so why should we?”\n\nThis mindset isn’t just corporate inertia; it’s deeply ingrained in our system. Look at politics—every government conveniently blames its predecessor for failures, avoiding accountability instead of looking within. This deflection game has become our collective DNA, shaped by the environment we operate in. And whether we like it or not, we’re all affected by it—including you and me.\n\nIt’s time we start asking the real question: When will we break this cycle of excuses and start owning our responsibilities?",

Connect what they do to what they truly want out of life.\n\nFor hard work, train habits. Look at how they manage their calendar, time, and task list. Spend time with them to show them where they are half-assing it.\n\nYou can't change everyone, but you can try before assuming they don't have the intangibles you are looking for.",

But there’s a question I keep coming back to:\n\n How do we ensure that AI systems deployed today will still be reliable, ethical, and effective years from now?\n\nThis isn’t just about AGI: it’s about the real-world AI systems being integrated into healthcare, finance, and business operations right now.\n\n How do we build AI that enhances decision-making rather than introducing new risks?\n What regulatory and compliance factors should businesses prepare for before AI policy catches up?\n Can we apply lessons from AI governance in other sectors to healthcare, business intelligence, and automation?\n\nThese are the questions that keep me up at night, and the ones I focus on in my work. AI governance isn’t just about stopping bad actors; it’s about building resilient, intelligent systems that create long-term value.\n\nWould love to hear from others: What’s the biggest AI risk businesses should be thinking about today?",

A good night’s sleep\n↳ Waking up well-rested can change your entire day. It’s one of the simplest yet most underrated forms of happiness.\n\n2. Good friends\n↳ Loneliness is an epidemic, especially in the US. Having even one solid friend? Priceless.\n\n3. A dog or cat\n↳ No matter how bad your day is, they still think you’re the best human on earth.\n\n4. Good home-cooked food\n↳ If you (or your partner) can cook well, every meal is a small luxury.\n\n5. Living near nature, the ocean, or a beautiful city\n↳ Views people pay thousands to visit might be right outside your door.\n\n6. Good weather\n↳ Californians know. Grey skies and freezing winters make you appreciate the sun.\n\n7. Reliable electricity and water\n↳ If you’ve ever lived without them, you know how essential they are.\n\n8. Not worrying about your next meal\n↳ Financial security, even at a basic level, is something many still fight for daily.\n\n9. Living in a peaceful city\n↳ No bombs, no sirens, no war outside your window. A privilege we rarely acknowledge.\n\n10. The Internet\n↳ Instant access to endless free knowledge. Something kings and scholars of the past could only dream of.\n\nAppreciate the \"boring\" things.\n\nThey might just be the best part of life.\n\n- - - - -\n\n️ Repost if this resonated with you!\n Follow me () for more",

        "content": "At the end of January, I had the honor of serving as a panelist at the Second Annual TechInLaw CLE Symposium, hosted by the University of South Carolina Joseph F. Rice School of Lawin the beautiful Karen J. Williams Courtroom.\n\nIt was an incredible experience to discuss the ethical use of AI, legal tech, and the associated cybersecurity/data privacy concerns alongside such esteemed industry leaders.\n\nThe event brought together over 150 attendees both online and in person, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the conversation on how technology is reshaping the legal landscape.\n\nA huge thank you our panel's moderatorfor leading an excellent panel discussion. It was a day of pure joy learning from and interacting with so many like-minded colleagues in this space such as,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and.\n\nI feel truly blessed and honored to have had the opportunity to share my experience leveraging AI technologies in my practice, while also delving into the very real data privacy and cybersecurity concerns surrounding the widespread use of large language models and natural language processing algorithms, such as ChatGPT.\n\nHere are my key takeaways:\n- When I first gave a CLE on ChatGPT in 2023, only 2 lawyers out of ~40 or so had heard of it or used it before...\n- At this event, nearly every attendee had utilized ChatGPT in some capacity.\n- \"AI\" is a buzz word and AI tools are increasingly entering a \"snake oil sales\" phase, with lawyers often being the target market.\n- I think this is comparable to past trendy buzz words such as blockchain, social media, mobile technology, internet of things, bluetooth/WiFi: (why do we need WiFi refrigerators...)\n-  It's crucial for legal professionals to understand the technology we adopt to avoid investing in costly tools that fail to meet expectations.\n- As legal professionals, we have an ethical responsibility to ensure that we are competent in understanding the technologies that are now ubiquitous in the legal landscape.\n- While some lawyers may be hesitant to embrace new technologies, many are eager to explore innovation.\n- However, there remains a societal perception that lawyers are somewhat technologically behind.\n- Asaptly pointed out, just as judges struggled to regulate the intersection of cars and railroads in their early days, the law will inevitably lag behind advancements in technology.\n\nI’d also like to express my deepest gratitude to the entire USC Rice School of Law team in particularfor making the symposium such a successful and enriching event.",

For each of the 67 systems that met the criteria for inclusion in the index, we documented the system’s components, application domains, and risk management practices based on publicly available information and correspondence with developers. Both raw data and web versions of all 67 agent cards are available.\n\nAgentic AI systems are being deployed at a steadily increasing rate. While some systems in the index were initially deployed in early 2023, approximately half of them were introduced in the second half of 2024. The majority of indexed agents specialize in software engineering and/or computer use.\n\nWe categorized the 67 agents into six groups: “software,” “computer use,” “universal,” “research,” “robotics,” and “other.” However, there is limited information regarding the risk management practices of developers of agentic systems, including their safety policies, internal testing, and external testing.\"\n\nGood work from, Luke Bailey, Rosco Hunter,,´,,, Kevin Wei,, Ariba Khan, Phillip Christoffersen, A.

        "content": "Elon Musk's recent $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI has ignited a significant debate regarding the future of artificial intelligence (AI) development and its governance. This unsolicited offer, led by Musk and supported by a consortium of investors, aims to take control of the nonprofit entity overseeing OpenAI. The proposal has been promptly rejected by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who humorously remarked about purchasing Twitter for a fraction of the price Musk paid.\n\nPros of Musk's Bid:\n\n1. **Return to Open-Source Mission:** Musk's consortium proposes to realign OpenAI with its original open-source, safety-focused mission, potentially fostering greater transparency and collaboration in AI development.\n\n2. **Diversification of AI Leadership:** Musk's involvement could introduce diverse perspectives into AI governance, potentially mitigating risks associated with monopolistic control by a single entity.\n\n3. **Enhanced Innovation:** With Musk's track record in technological innovation, his leadership might accelerate advancements in AI, benefiting various sectors.\n\nCons of Musk's Bid:\n\n1. **Potential for Centralized Control:** Consolidating control of OpenAI under Musk could lead to centralized decision-making, potentially limiting diverse input and oversight in AI development.\n\n2. **Conflict of Interest:** Musk's existing ventures, such as xAI, may present conflicts of interest, raising concerns about prioritizing personal business interests over broader societal benefits.\n\n3. **Disruption of Existing Partnerships:** OpenAI's collaborations with entities like Microsoft and Oracle could be jeopardized, potentially disrupting ongoing projects and partnerships.\n\n**Implications for the Public and Government:**\n\n- Public Access and Safety:The public's access to AI technologies and the safety of these systems could be influenced by Musk's leadership, depending on his commitment to ethical AI development.\n\n-Regulatory Oversight: Government agencies may need to reassess regulatory frameworks to address the implications of such a significant shift in AI governance, ensuring that public interests are safeguarded.\n\nIn conclusion, while Musk's bid presents potential benefits in terms of innovation and realigning OpenAI with its foundational mission, it also raises concerns about centralized control, conflicts of interest, and the impact on existing partnerships. The ultimate outcome will depend on balancing these factors to ensure that AI development serves the broader public good.",

Within a few months Bethany was...\n being actively managed out of the company\n targeted by her manager who wanted their friend to take over her role\n excluded from speaking engagements and industry conferences\n taken off projects that she was leading\n replaced by younger unqualified employees favored by their manager\n received a predatory performance review despite exceeding all goals\n only member of her team that did not receive a raise, bonus, or additional RSU grant, as she had received the prior year\n\nIt was shocking how Bethany was being treated given her stature in the industry and having received nothing but positive feedback throughout her tenure.\n\nAfter having met with several attorneys, Bethany reached out to our service and signed up, favoring our approach to an attorney. She found our process to be extremely therapeutic.\n\nBethan did a fantastic job documenting her experience and putting together a moving and impactful document and counter to their severance offer.\n\nThrough 3 rounds of negotiations, she was able to increase her offer from 1 month to 4 months after less than 2 years of employment and was satisfied with it and moved on.\n\nWe were able to complete the process from signing up with us to a check in her bank in 9 weeks.

It only matters what they learn.\n\nIt’s not about what you know or what you say.\nIt’s about what the other person actually takes away.\n\nAre they engaged? Are they connecting the dots? Are they walking away with something valuable?\n\nOr are they not so discretely slacking their coworker, \"Bruh, this demo is rough.\"\n\nWe’ve all been there. And if you’ve ever caught yourself in one of these traps, you’re not alone.\n\nSo let's try not to:\n\n- Feature Dump\nBuyers don’t remember lists of features. They remember how you can help them, not that your software has all these integrations most of which they don't care about and won't use.\n\n- Talk Too Much\nIf the buyer isn’t talking, they’re probably not learning. And if you’ve been monologuing for 15 minutes straight, they’re definitely daydreaming about lunch.\n\n- Surface level Disco\nIf your discovery call is just \"So… what keeps you up at night?\" (Please for the love of all things ... don't ask this!) you’re getting surface-level answers. No real context = no real connection.\n\n- Sell on Logic, Not Emotion\nYes, we all love our ROI calculators. No, they will not magically make the buyer care (sorry marketing). People don’t buy because of efficiency metrics they buy because they feel like your solution is the right move for their needs.\n\n- Focus on What You Know, Not What They Need to Learn\nYour product knowledge is fascinating (go you for getting all your in house certifications!). But your buyer just wants to know: \"How does this make my life easier?/How does this help me keep my job?\"\n\n- Leav No Clear Next Steps\n\"Let’s circle back next week\" is not a next step. It’s an invitation for your deal to disappear into the void.",

It’s optimized for speed and consistency.\n↳ OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is used for reporting and analysis, like sales trends over time. It focuses on complex queries and aggregations.\n\n Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema\n↳ Star Schema has a simple structure with one central fact table and multiple dimension tables. It makes querying faster.\n↳ Snowflake Schema further normalizes data, reducing duplication but making queries slightly slower. It’s useful when storage optimization is important.\n\n Fact & Dimension Tables\n↳ Fact Tables store numerical data like sales, revenue, or order quantities.\n↳ Dimension Tables store descriptive details like customer names, product categories, or time details.\n↳ Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) help track changes in data over time (e.g., updating customer addresses).\n\n Normalization & Denormalization\n↳ Normalization organizes data into multiple tables to remove duplication and maintain consistency (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).\n↳ Denormalization combines tables to reduce joins and speed up analytics queries, making it useful for OLAP systems.\n\n Indexing & Partitioning\n↳ Indexes help speed up search queries in databases, like an index in a book.\n↳ Partitioning breaks large datasets into smaller chunks, improving performance in big data systems.\n\n ETL vs ELT\n↳ ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Data is cleaned and transformed before loading into the database. Used in traditional systems.\n↳ ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): Data is first loaded into a data warehouse, then transformed. This is common in cloud-based architectures.\n\nThe best way to master Data Modeling is by applying it in real-world projects.\n\nSchedule a mentorship call with me:\nJoin me:\nFollow for more ",
