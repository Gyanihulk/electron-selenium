It got me 500k+ impressions in a month and my DMs flooded.\n\nWas it something negative ? No\nIt was just a unpopular opinion that a lot of people don‚Äôt agree with and a lot of people who agree stopped because they can finally see someone talk about it in publish.\n\nBoth of which is fine.\n\nAs a human you are not bound to agree to everything and till the time you are not being negative or being hurtful to anyone it‚Äôs absolutely fine to put your opinion forward.\n\nAnd trust me most of the successful founders have a lot of things that probably do not align with what most people belief in.\n\nDo you think putting out controversial / unpopular opinions is necessary?",

Like any good sales process, enablement needs discovery:\n\n- What's the real problem you're trying to solve?\n- Has this training been done before?\n- How will we measure success?\n- What's the timeline for meaningful impact?\n\n\nIn the full episode, we covered:\n\n- How JLL runs their \"Power Hour\" program across 600+ global sellers\n- Practical frameworks for building sustainable enablement programs\n- Strategies for engaging multi-generational remote teams\n- Why random training requests kill enablement effectiveness\n- Tips for aligning with sales leaders and getting executive buy-in\n\n\nSomething that really stood out: Brooke's team maintains a 70/30 split between programmatic and ad-hoc enablement - proving you can balance structure with flexibility.\n\n\nWant to hear the full conversation on building effective everboarding programs?\n\nCheck out the link in comments ",
