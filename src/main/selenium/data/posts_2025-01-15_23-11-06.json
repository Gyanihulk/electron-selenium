It has turned into a confusing and often political landscape that is not much different than FB. We are not supposed to try to get meetings or introduce our services, and 90% of posts don't reach more than 10% of our followers and connections.\n\nHowever, I promised to share the results, so here they are.\nThere were 408 views and 7 \"me\" comments.\n\nI've hired and fired no less than 4 LI experts in 2024 who promised to expand my network with my ICP and generate leads with ZERO results.
