You need to understand return metrics.\n\nBut if you're not a financial analyst, it can be overwhelming.\n\nSo, let's keep it simple.\n\nThere are two key return metrics you need to understand:\n\n1. Cash-on-Cash Return\n2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nCash-on-cash return is easy to understand. It's the percentage of cash generated by the property relative to the amount you invested.\n\nIRR is a more detailed metric that accounts for the time value of money and factors in the length of the investment, cash flows, and the terminal value of the property.\n\nBoth these metrics, when analyzed together, can give you a comprehensive understanding of how an investment property will perform over the investment horizon.\n\nSo, when making investment decisions, make sure these metrics are analyzed.\n\nInvest smart and enjoy the returns!\n\nWant to learn more about Multifamily Investing?

Jason listed all the things founders would ‚Äòregret\":\n\n- Not paying up for top hires\n- Under-hiring\n- Not raising more money\n- Not being closer to customers\n- Not doing enough biz dev\n- Having too high burn rate\n- Founder conflict\n\nYou know what's ironic?\n\nI had just spoken to a founder who followed Jason's playbook to the letter.\n\nRaised $40M, landed that sweet $25M Series B at a $200M valuation in 2021.\n\nHe thought he was on the SaaStr success path.\n\nNow? Total zombie company.\n\nAfter drinking the VC kool-aid, he went on the exact hiring and spending spree Jason preaches.\n\nBuilt out a bloated \"enterprise platform\", spent millions on those \"can't-miss top hires\" that Jason insists you'll regret not overpaying for.\n\nFor 6 months, it looked like the SaaStr formula was working.\n\nARR climbing, logos landing, VCs applauding.\n\nThe last 18 months?\n\nA masterclass in why this advice is stuck in the past.\n\nLayoffs, toxic culture, customers fleeing.\n\nHere's what Jason won't tell you:\n\nBefore that Series B, when they were ignoring the VC wisdom, they were lean, focused, product-driven, with actual product-market fit.\n\nThe real kicker?\n\nTheir ARR today is right back to pre-Series B levels.\n\nBefore all that \"smart money\" came in.\n\nBut now instead of being capital efficient, they're burning cash.\n\nInstead of a focused product solving real problems, they've got a bloated platform chasing the enterprise dreams Jason is talking about.\n\nThe last 8 quarters have been brutal. No way out.\n\nThey burned through runway following the SaaStr playbook.\n\nNo path to the 10x return their investors expected.\n\nI almost fell for it too.\n\nIn 2016, I nearly killed Groove trying to play by these rules‚Äìchasing VC validation, forcing growth, building for potential investors instead of customers.\n\nBut unlike my friend who's stuck with a zombie company...\n\nAs a bootstrapped founder, I could ignore the VC \"wisdom\". Focus on actual customer value.\n\nWe cut waste. Double down on product. Listen to customers, not conference keynotes.\n\nHit rough patches sure, but built something real that I fully control.\n\nWhat's next for my VC-backed friend? It hurts to watch.\n\nWhat's next for us? Building real value at our own pace.\n\nHere's my 2025 regret list for founders:\n\n-If you can bootstrap (hint: you can)... bootstrap.\n\nLet‚Äôs stop selling founders the 2015 playbook.\n\nThe game has changed.",

This disconnect can lead to stalled progress and unmet goals, even when the effort is there.\n\nThe Scorecard, a cornerstone of EOS, helps solve this by making accountability visible and measurable. Recently, a leadership team I worked with struggled to hit their sales goals because follow-ups were slipping through the cracks. With a weekly Scorecard, they identified the problem, adjusted their process, and saw a 25% increase in sales within a quarter.\n\nEOS turns plans into progress by bringing clarity and focus to execution.\n\nAre you ready to make your strategy actionable?

I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôre going to have to let you go.‚Äù\n\nAt Netflix, for example, we never thought of ourselves as a family. We always considered ourselves more like a sports team. And not a Little League team, where everyone gets to play and at the end of the season everyone gets a trophy.\n\nNo, we were a professional team playing at the highest level, and my responsibility as manager wasn‚Äôt to make sure everyone got playing time. It was to make sure I put the best possible team on the field for every game. I did that because I owed that to the team owners. I owed it to the fans. And most importantly, I owed it to the other players.\n\nI learned a long time ago that what the best players want is not just a friendly attitude in the locker room. They want to know that everyone excels at their position. They want to know that everyone will be trying as hard as they can. They want to win.\n\nThat‚Äôs why a manager‚Äôs job is not just to hire well and motivate your team to be the best they can be. It‚Äôs also to make sure that when someone isn‚Äôt holding their end, you‚Äôre the person who sits them down and explains why you‚Äôre sending them down to the minors.\n\nThis is especially hard in a startup, because in almost every case, the players you start with aren‚Äôt going to be the ones you finish with. At the beginning, you‚Äôre looking for generalists. Since you don‚Äôt yet know what they will need to be great at, you want people who are good at a lot of things. You want people who are comfortable with the fact that their job description is going to change weekly. You want people who are motivated by the adventure, rather than by stability.\n\nThat first team is going to give you everything they have. They‚Äôll leave better paying jobs with great benefits to work for a fraction of their salary. They‚Äôll work nights and weekends. They‚Äôll do everything you ask‚Äîand then some.\nSo it‚Äôs especially brutal when your company is just starting to take off, and you have to sit someone down and tell them that they won‚Äôt be coming with you on the next stage of the journey. Or that you‚Äôre bringing in a more experienced executive over them.\n\nThat part is neither easy nor fun. But it‚Äôs the job. And if I can‚Äôt do that, I don‚Äôt deserve to be in my position either.",

      "content": "\"Maybe I can go out on my own.\"\n\nThis was one of my first thoughts when I lost my job in September.\n\nBut I quickly shot it down.\n\nI needed a stable job, I told myself. Besides, I figured it would take a long time to find enough work to make up for a full-time salary.\n\nSo I picked up some work here and there while I focused on my job search.\n\nThen, in December, a couple things happened:\n\n1. A job opportunity I thought I had ‚Äî one that I was really looking forward to ‚Äî fell through. And I didn't have any other prospects on the horizon.\n\n2. I looked at the list of freelance assignments I had on my plate and realized, \"This is more than 'some work here and there.' Maybe I can actually do this now.\"\n\nAfter crunching the numbers, having lots of conversations with my extremely supportive family and talking with some of my freelancer friends, I decided:\n\nI'm going into business for myself.\n\nSo far I've been doing a little bit of everything: content writing and editing, website copywriting, PR and social media. I'm going to keep doing that.\n\nBut my long-term vision is to focus on helping B2B tech founders and execs build their brands through thought leadership. That's something I've enjoyed doing a lot of at my past jobs and had a lot of success with.\n\nAm I scared? Yes ‚Äî but not any more scared than I'd be if I were starting a new job or continuing to navigate this horrible job market.\n\nThere are no guarantees that any of those paths will work out.\n\nSo I'm picking the one that I have control over.",
