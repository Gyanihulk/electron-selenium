      "content": "Making the transition from a large enterprise to an early-stage startup demands a significant mindset shift. The two have starkly different management and leadership styles. For example, my management style atsignificantly differed from that at. On a day-to-day basis, I make many decisions and bold steps that I would have never taken at Airbnb, as they would have required buy-in from many stakeholders or simply wouldn't make sense there.\n\nWhile executives in established corporations may view their roles as just another \"job,\" startup founders consider themselves parents of a \"fragile newborn in the NICU.\" Any misstep in strategy or execution could swiftly escalate into a critical situation, which will reflect in the founder's execution strategy.\n\nHence, working directly with founders in the early stages of a startup can prove challenging, especially for individuals accustomed to the structured environment of a large organization. Startups are not a conventional game. The odds of failure are over 95%. Hence, startup execution strategies are also not conventional. They are purely optimized to increase the survival odds early on and can be highly ambitious and unconventional.\n\nFounders must establish clear expectations from the outset of the hiring process. It is paramount to align the company's mission and career objectives with those of potential hires. Founders should set expectations early on during the hiring process. It's very important to find vision and career objective alignment. It's better to stay away from highly qualified candidates who are just looking for another job!\n\nSimilarly, anyone who is planning to join an early-stage startup should understand the clear \"Why\" of why they want to join a startup.",

Ask yourself if your problem is big enough\nEnsure the problem you're solving is significant enough to justify building a company around it.\n\n2. Hire generalists\nIn the early stages, versatile employees who can handle diverse tasks are more valuable than specialists.\n\n3. Don't waste your time on social media. Manage your time wisely\nFocus on productive activities instead of getting distracted by social media.\n\n4. Give all employees shares\nSharing equity motivates employees to work towards the company’s success as if it were their own.\n\n5. Be aware if you scale too fast\nScaling prematurely can lead to organizational and operational chaos.\n\n6. Don't chase big markets from day one. Start in a niche\nBegin by dominating a smaller market before expanding into larger ones.\n\n7. Conferences and networking are overrated\nAttending endless events may not yield significant results; focus on tangible actions.\n\n8. Don't get nervous if someone copies you\nImitation is inevitable; stay ahead by continually innovating.\n\n9. Be prepared to face a variety of topics: tech, compliance, legal, organization\nRunning a business means dealing with challenges across multiple disciplines.\n\n10. Managing people is much harder than you think\nBuilding and leading a team is one of the toughest aspects of a business.\n\n11. In customer support, people will insult you\nSome customers will vent their frustrations harshly; don’t take it personally.\n\n12. You can't please everyone\nAccept that not every decision will satisfy everyone, and that’s okay.\n\n13. Learn to say no to features\nPrioritize features that align with your vision; don’t try to build everything.\n\n14. Technology is only half the battle. Learn to build a business model\nEven great tech needs a solid business strategy to succeed.\n\n15. The entire journey is a rollercoaster\nExpect emotional highs and lows as part of the entrepreneurial experience.\n\n16. Be ready to make sacrifices. Founding means giving things up\nEntrepreneurship often requires sacrificing personal time and comfort. If you prefer a 9-to-5 job, that’s fine, but it won’t take you far.\n\n17. Ideally, start in your native language for better support\nBegin with a smaller, localized audience to provide superior customer support before scaling globally.\n\n18. Bootstrap only if you can endure hardship\nWithout external funding, prepare for financial and emotional challenges.\n\n19. Brand and trust are everything\nBuilding a strong brand and trust with your customers is crucial for long-term success.\n\n20. Don’t get complacent when things are going well\nSuccess can lead to overconfidence and stagnation. Stay vigilant, keep innovating, and always look for ways to improve and adapt, even when the business is thriving.",
