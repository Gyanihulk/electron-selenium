        "content": "I‚Äôm happy to share that I‚Äôm starting a new position as Head of GTM Growth at Momentum.io!\n\nI found Momentum and bought it at a past company, LOVED the team and tech. After purchasing, I became a GTM customer advisor giving feedback and having a ton of fun with using some crazy prompts inside of their tech.\n\nThis last year, I have had the pleasure of doing some public events with them and leading the AI Advantage webinar series as a GTM Ambassador.\n\nCouple weeks ago,and I had a chat about leading the GTM Growth, marketing, brand ofand even though its not obviously my historical background being in Sales, GTM Strategy and obviously Enablement, it made sense to me and I am so excited.\n\nNot to be too promotion-ee, but for me with work, I have been through a lot and I always look for 3 things with any job which are:\n1-Amazing Product, company and trajectory\n2-Amazing team and culture\n3-Amazing job that I love\n\nI have been blessed to have had some good roles, but not all roles I have had, have hit all 3 of those categories. Transparently, I thought they would at first and eventually, they did not.\n\nis a different beast, here is why:\n1-Their leadership and founders are what I call the Trinity of founders.,, andare truly the most talented, smart, emotionally intelligent, forward thinking founders I have yet worked with and how they treat customers is how they treat their team.\n\n2-The team behind them is just as smart, fun, hard working, and inspiring. I LOVE teams where I feel like I need to push to keep up with the talent.. That is Momentum through and through and the team pushes me to be better.\n\n3-The tech. Over the last 2 years, not only have I seen demos of 500+ AI tools, but I have seen a lot of those tools in action when consulting or advising dozens of companies. With Momentum, the tech is the epitome of what AI + GTM should be. Any team on the GTM team, can benefit fromfrom the front line sales rep to the CEO. And the product roadmap is something I am geeking out on as an AI crazy person.\n\n4-My role. Leading brand, marketing, growth, etc. I get to flex all my muscles from leading a product marketing team, GTM Strategy, my MBA in Marketing fromand my AI market and tool awareness as well as my AI knowledge all combined into one. I literally will be paid to play all day with Ai, talking about AI and GTM. Literally dream job.\n\n5-,, and other projects are still ongoing and will not stop anytime soon and thankfully the Momentum team is not only ok with it, but supports it.\n\nI am extremely grateful, excited, and ready for this next step. If your GTM team, sales, enablement, revops, or leaders need help with scaling AI in your team, come talk to me. Happy to show you how to build Momentum (get it ;) with your AI strategy and revenue.",

        "content": "I always thought companies had a Sales Problem. Turns out, they had a ‚ÄòPeople Can‚Äôt Make Decisions‚Äô Problem.\n\nA rep walks into a pipeline review. Their deal is stuck. The prospect ‚Äúneeds more time.‚Äù Leadership is ‚Äústill discussing.‚Äù Meanwhile, the sales manager is staring at Salesforce like it's a crystal ball of doom‚Äî\"Why do we have so many deals in ‚ÄòCommit‚Äô but not closing?\"\nMost sales teams don‚Äôt struggle to close. They struggle to make buyers realize they need to buy. And when that happens, your CRM becomes a graveyard of ‚Äòalmost deals‚Äô instead of a tool for predictable revenue. Here are the things that actually move the needle:-\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ They Sell the Cost of Doing Nothing (And Make It Impossible to Ignore)\nYour Salesforce pipeline is full of deals that are technically alive but mentally dead. Why? Because reps pitch ROI, but buyers are more afraid of loss than they are excited about gain.\n ‚ÄúWe can 10x your efficiency!‚Äù\n ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre currently losing $500K a year. Every month you delay, that‚Äôs $42K gone.‚Äù\n2Ô∏è‚É£ They Don‚Äôt Sell to the Decision-Maker First (Because That‚Äôs a Fast Track to Nowhere)\nYour Salesforce instance probably has 100+ deals tagged as ‚ÄúWaiting for CFO Approval.That CFO hasn‚Äôt even opened your email. Great reps equip internal champions‚Äîthe ones actually feeling the pain‚Äîto sell for them.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ They Engineer Small ‚ÄúYeses‚Äù to Get to the Big Yes\nYour deals feel too big and scary to commit. Smart teams break it down:\n ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs agree this is a problem worth solving.‚Äù\n ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs align on success metrics.‚Äù\n ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs run a small pilot.‚Äù\nBy the time you ask for the big commitment, they‚Äôve already made it.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ They Use Reverse Pricing Psychology (So Buyers Don‚Äôt Flinch at the Number)\n ‚ÄúThis will cost $50K.‚Äù ‚Üí Ouch.\n ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre losing $500K a year. Fixing that costs $50K.‚Äù ‚Üí Take my money.\n5Ô∏è‚É£  They Make Pipeline Reviews Fun (Yes, Really)\nMost Salesforce pipeline reviews are glorified autopsies‚Äîa manager scrolling through deals asking, ‚ÄúWhy is this stuck?‚Äù over and over again.\nHigh-performing teams? They turn pipeline reviews into deal strategy sessions:\n Leaderboards for pipeline velocity\n Live objection-handling roleplays\n Win/Loss autopsies that actually teach something\nBecause if pipeline meetings aren‚Äôt helping your reps close, what‚Äôs the point?\nWith Clientell, AI takes the guesswork out of managing your salesforce. Instead of wasting hours in Salesforce trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong, your team gets real-time insights and nudges that actually move deals forward.\n\nTakeaway:\nYour sales strategy doesn‚Äôt need more pressure. It needs better decision-making. Win the right champion, make it easy to say yes, flip the pricing conversation, and stop treating Salesforce as a deal graveyard.\nWhat‚Äôs one non-traditional sales move that helped your team win a deal? Drop it below‚ÄîI promise I won‚Äôt ‚Äújust follow up‚Äù later. ",

Under comments also.\n\nHumbling? Absolutely. Surprising? Not entirely.\n\nHere‚Äôs why:\n\n3 Lessons From Climbing a List I Never Aimed For\n\n1. Authenticity Over Algorithms\n\nI didn‚Äôt chase trends or mimic ‚Äúguru formulas.‚Äù I shared raw stories of my failures, burnout, and comebacks. People don‚Äôt connect with polish‚Äîthey connect with people.\n\n2. Consistency Beats Virality\n\nOne viral post won‚Äôt sustain influence. But showing up daily‚Äîeven when engagement is low‚Äîbuilds trust. This ranking reflects 12 years of imperfect, relentless effort.\n\n3. Impact Isn‚Äôt a Solo Sport\n\nEvery comment, DM, or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù from you fueled this. Your courage to act is the real win‚Äîmy role was just to hand you the match.\n\nWhy This Matters Beyond the Ranking\n\nBeing alongside icons isn‚Äôt about ego‚Äîit‚Äôs proof that ordinary people can create extraordinary change without fame or Fortune 500 budgets.\n\nThe ‚Äúexperts‚Äù don‚Äôt own motivation; you do.\n\nHere‚Äôs My Challenge to You\n\nYou don‚Äôt need a Top 30 title to lead. Start where you are:\n\n- Host that workshop.\n- Post that vulnerable story.\n- Mentor one person.\n\nLegacy isn‚Äôt built in rankings‚Äîit‚Äôs built in the quiet moments when you choose courage over comfort.\n\nQuestion for you:\n\nWhat‚Äôs one fear you‚Äôll push past this week to make your voice matter?\n\n Let‚Äôs unpack it in the comments.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nP.S. Gratitude to every person who trusted me with their journey. This is your win too.",

I think many of us primarily know our state legislators from the political side: their votes and what we see in the news. What I loved about tonight was that we got to hear about their human side: their backgrounds outside of politics and struggles they overcame. I was able to grab photos with Reps.,, and Kate Donaghue, but Senate Presidentand Reps.andalso provided some great insights. Also a shoutout to the amazingfor her help at the event (and being an important part of), and our wonderful chamber team ofand Luiza Barros de Oliveira for organizing the event.",

It‚Äôs thought that Wozniak felt Apple were focusing too much on the Mac while neglecting the Apple II, which was the product that had put Apple on the map.\n\nFor business owners, this moment in tech history serves as a powerful reminder: Never lose sight of what made you successful in the first place.\n\nWhile innovation is important, so is maintaining the trust and loyalty of your core customers. It‚Äôs a tricky dance, but one worth mastering. And it‚Äôs essential for sustainable growth.\n\nSince leaving Apple, Wozniak has continued to be a shareholder and occasional advisor while exploring other passions. Many people in the tech world think of him as an icon who isn‚Äôt afraid to do what he feels is right, whether it breaks new ground or not.\n\nHow does your business strike the balance between embracing new ideas and nurturing what‚Äôs already working?",
