Whether you're charging at home or on the go, the design offers an alternative EV charging solution that can be safer and more convenient than ever.\n\nThe GHOST flat cable is weather-resistant, preventing freezing and stiffening in cold temperatures which makes it unique in their current ability to perform under the toughest conditions.\n\nWith the capability to deliver up to 40A and 9.6kW, Ghost provides up to 30 miles of charge per hour.\n\nIn Europe and China, their 50A model delivers up to 48 miles per hour, ensuring fast and efficient charging for all EVs. Plus they offer a mode three cable.\n\nPlus, the charger‚Äôs low profile meets ADA requirements, making it safe for pedestrians and still offering high performance.\n\nThey are also working on a retractable wall charger, and later on an inductive charging pad featuring their flat cable technology.\n\nClearly they are well positioned to provide a flexible, reliable solution for city dwellers, suburban homeowners, and businesses.\n\nNice work/ David Sirieix",
