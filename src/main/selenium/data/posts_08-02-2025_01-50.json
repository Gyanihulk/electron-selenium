        "content": "If you‚Äôre an early stage startup between $250k-$1.5M/ARR, here‚Äôs how you comp your first sales hire:\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nEarly stage comp plans during ZIPR were insane.\n\n$300-400k OTEs with effective quotas of $250-400k/year were not uncommon.\n\nThis was driven by companies raising gobs of capital AND trying to compete with mature companies offering generous ramp times, draws, and big OTEs.\n\nIt‚Äôs a tricky situation for early founders.\n\nFounders don‚Äôt yet have the sales yield where a rep can bring in 5-6x their OTE in bookings. Yet, they still need to bring in top talent and pay close to market rate to attract them.\n\nSo what do you do?\n\nHere's how I would structure the first comp plan (shoutout Jason M. Lemkin):\n\nThe rep doesn‚Äôt get paid commission until they pay for themselves. Once they pay for themselves in terms of base salary, they start getting a hefty commission rate with accelerators.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nMarket rate for the type of a rep you need is ~$180k OTE or $90k/year base ($7.5k/mo). They do not make any commission until they close their first $7.5k/mo or $22.5k/quarter.\n\nOnce they go above that, they make a flat commission of all deals of 18% (this rate is based on rough goal of what you think is possible + getting right around the market rate).\n\nAssuming they can sell ~$600k/year (based on real historicals, not out of whack expectations based on other markets/companies), then they would end up making:\n\n$90k base\n$108k variable\n$198k total\n\nEquity should be a part of this plan but most early reps are joining for cash upside more than anything else.\n\nWHY I LIKE THIS PLAN:\n\nIt gives sellers a lot of upside ‚Äì the best AEs know they should be able to maximize the revenue from each new lead or opportunity\n\nIt‚Äôs simple ‚Äì complex comp plans are dangerous and ripe for gaming\n\nYou attract the right type of talent ‚Äì ones that want to bet on themselves and see the upside in closing the next big deal, having the biggest quarter, etc.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF THE REP START CRUSHING IT:\n\nThe CEO of Qualtrics said he had 25 year olds making $500k/yr selling Qualtrics from his basement. They raised no money at the time so it was more evenly distributed toward variable comp.\n\nThe 4th and 5th rep are taking less risk and it should be much easier to sell with proven customers, reputable logos, and a bit of awareness. It‚Äôs completely reasonable for them to get a smaller % of every deal.\n\nWhat I‚Äôve found is that you can use equity to get people aligned to long term goals while continuing to make a lot of cash. The best reps realize they can make a lot of money over time OR you get them into a management track with more equity and less cash upside.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n\nThe market has adjusted back to reality.\n\nThere are still deeply funded and extremely profitable companies that are hard to compete with.\n\nA straight forward, variable heavy plan with a lot of upside will attracts the right sales talent.\n\nThen, do everything humanly possible to keep them drowning in pipeline and excited.",

I do business so that I can do personal things.\n\nAnd I'm on Linkedin to support and help my business community with their companies and their lives.\n\nWith that said...\n\nMy little brother, Jacob Boswell, has cancer.\n\nI've lost my sister Ruth, my older brother, Ben, and my mother, Kristine - all died way too soon and left huge holes in my heart.\n\nWe are all praying that Jacob is spared and that an up-coming surgery will clean it out and that it will stop spreading.\n\nI love my brother.\n\nAs teens we loved going head to head with each other. Full on fist fights and brawls. It was great! \n\nBut we always gave bro-hugs afterwards and remained best friends.\n\nHe's supported me in tough times and I've supported him in tough times.\n\nThat's what brothers do for each other, right? \n\nWell, now he is in crisis. So many things have crashed on him at once.\n\nThe vial, horrible monster of cancer is just one thing... there are others.\n\nAs a family, we are doing everything we can for him.\n\nBut this got bigger than all of us.\n\nSo, we are asking for help from our extended community.\n\nEmotional, spiritual and financial support for Jacob.\n\nI'm asking you to help if and as you can.\n\nI'll put a link in the comments for full details or you can get QR code in the pictures.\n\nMy friends, business and life are much the same... both are about giving value to help our fellow humans solve their challenges and live better.\n\nI've no doubt that you serve and give in your sphere of influence. And if you can help here, I know Jacob and his family would really appreciate it.\n\nIf you do, please DM me so I can thank you properly.\n\nThank you and God bless you.",

However, potential legal/TOS issues exist with using Gemini for model distillation. The research demonstrates how smaller, focused training approaches might challenge the assumption that state-of-the-art AI requires massive resources.",

        "content": "resilience+Rise Podcast: A conversation with Kal Dosanjh: Part 1\n\nFrom the Streets to Solutions:‚Äôs Mission to Empower Youth\n\nA single encounter with a 15-year-old struggling with addiction led to a powerful realization‚Äîthese kids aren‚Äôt just statistics; they are products of their environment, in need of support and guidance.\n\nThis week on the Resilience+Rise podcast, we sit down with Kal Dosanjh, a veteran police officer with 25 years of service, including 8 years patrolling Vancouver‚Äôs Downtown Eastside. His journey from witnessing the harsh realities of street life to creating impactful solutions is one you won‚Äôt want to miss.\n\nKal's story isn't just about law enforcement; it's about understanding the root causes of crime and creating real, lasting change.\n\nKal shares his experiences in one of North America's most challenging environments, describing the complex socio-economic factors that contribute to the open-air drug market and the cycle of violence. He talks about the \"perfect storm\" of social housing, mental health challenges, and organized crime that plagues the Downtown Eastside. But more importantly, he shares the pivotal moment that shifted his focus from reactive policing to proactive community building.\n\nThis realization led Kal to found the KidsPlay Foundation, a registered charity dedicated to providing youth with positive alternatives. He explains the six streams of KidsPlay's work ‚Äì education, sports, mentorship, environment, clinical counseling, and community patrol ‚Äì and shares inspiring stories of kids whose lives have been transformed. From educational field trips to sports programs and mentorship opportunities, KidsPlay offers a lifeline to vulnerable youth, helping them develop valuable skills and make positive choices. Kal's powerful \"mahout\" metaphor perfectly illustrates the importance of instilling positive values early in life.\n\nJoin me, Thomas Scaria, ultra-marathoner and resilience coach, as I talk with Kal about his incredible journey, the challenges facing inner-city youth, and the transformative power of hope and opportunity. This is a conversation that will leave you inspired and motivated to make a difference.\n\nTune in to the Resilience+Rise podcast now! (Full Podcast & connection in the comments)",

I agree that it's important for employees to take their vacation time and prioritize their well-being. In fact, studies have shown that taking time off can increase productivity and creativity. It's also important for companies to create a culture that encourages and supports taking time off. This can include setting clear expectations for PTO usage, providing resources for vacation planning, and leading by example by taking time off themselves.

        "content": "What did I create?\n\nI developed a new AI system called Convergent Hierarchical Reasoning (CHR). Think of CHR as a ‚Äúsuper brain‚Äù that combines four different thinking strategies into one neat package. Instead of having separate parts for different tasks, CHR brings them all together so the computer can process complex problems more smoothly and clearly.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nMany organizations, especially in government and defense, need AI systems that are fast, reliable, and easy to understand. Traditional AI systems are like having several independent experts who don‚Äôt always communicate well with each other‚Äîthis can lead to delays, mistakes, and extra costs. CHR is important because it reduces these problems by unifying all the reasoning into one system. This makes it easier to audit (check for errors), secure (protect from breaches), and maintain (keep running efficiently), which is critical for high-stakes tasks.\n\nWhat is it capable of doing?\n\nBreaking Down Problems: CHR uses a method called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to split complex problems into simple, clear steps.\n\nExploring Multiple Options: With Forest-of-Thought (FoT), it examines many possible solutions at once, ensuring the best path is chosen.\n\nOrganizing Decisions: It uses the Trilevel Reasoning Graph (TRG) to organize its thinking into big-picture (strategic), mid-level (tactical), and detailed (operational) decisions.\n\nHandling Lots of Data Efficiently: Finally, Logarithmic Memory Networks (LMNs) help CHR manage large amounts of information quickly without using too many resources.\n\nOverall Summary:\n\nCHR is a powerful, unified AI framework designed to simplify and improve complex decision-making processes. By combining multiple advanced reasoning techniques into one system, it can make decisions faster, more accurately, and at a lower cost. This makes it especially valuable for critical applications like government training, military planning, or cybersecurity, where transparency, security, and efficiency are key. In short, CHR is like having one super-efficient, super-smart brain that is easier to manage and trust than a group of separate, less coordinated systems.\n\nClick Link Below to Read Research Paper:",

Schedule dedicated study blocks (2-3 hours max).\n2. Practice daily mindfulness or meditation (10-15 mins).\n3. Set clear boundaries between study and personal time.\n4. Use the Pomodoro technique (25 mins work, 5 mins rest).\n5. Track your energy levels and adjust your workload accordingly.\n6. Create a weekly self-care routine (exercise, hobbies, friends).\n7. Connect with Boom‚Äôs AI counseling for personalized support.\n\nHow to implement this system:\n‚Ä¢ Block 2 hours daily for exercise and relaxation.\n‚Ä¢ Use Boom‚Äôs check-ins to monitor emotions and stress.\n‚Ä¢ Set realistic academic goals each semester.\n‚Ä¢ Make time for social connections.\n‚Ä¢ Plan your week every Sunday.\n\nThis simple system helped me maintain a 3.8 GPA at\nwhile preserving my mental health.\n\nThe key takeaway: Prioritize both grades and well-being, not one over the other.

No, I didn't send out my application because I'm not actively looking for another job yet!\n\nBut I was happy that my hardwork on\nis not going unnoticed!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ I mean, if I needed another job asap I would have gotten that offer without running after a recruiter.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ If this is not the power of personal branding, then I don't know what else it is.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ I promise you, the job offers are here but the reason it hasn't gotten to you yet is because, whenever there's an opening, these recruiters reach out to those that they know has a strong personal brand.\n\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ And if all you do everyday is apply to 100 jobs without putting the same level of effort into building your brand, then you already know what the outcome would be.\n\n\nThis is the DAY3 of the \"I hour steal my brain session sign-up\" and you still have the opportunity to join the rest in learning how to position yourself as a go-to in your niche.\n\n\nPS: I left some nice updates in the comments!\n\n.",

That‚Äôs why I appreciate‚Äôs TACO Framework (Taskers, Automators, Collaborators, Orchestrators)‚Äîa practical, structured way to think about enterprise AI adoption. <link below>\n\nHere‚Äôs why this approach resonates with me:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ ùóúùòÅ ùó±ùó≤ùó∫ùòÜùòÄùòÅùó∂ùó≥ùó∂ùó≤ùòÄ ùóîùóú ùóÆùó¥ùó≤ùóªùòÅùòÄ. Instead of vague, overhyped promises, TACO provides a structured way to assess what agents can actually do today and where they‚Äôre headed.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ ùóúùòÅ ùóÆùóπùó∂ùó¥ùóªùòÄ ùòÑùó∂ùòÅùóµ ùóøùó≤ùóÆùóπ ùó≤ùóªùòÅùó≤ùóøùóΩùóøùó∂ùòÄùó≤ ùó∞ùóµùóÆùóπùóπùó≤ùóªùó¥ùó≤ùòÄ. Businesses don‚Äôt need ‚Äúsuper agents‚Äù overnight. They need pragmatic, high-impact automation that solves real problems, starting with Taskers and Automators before scaling.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ ùóúùòÅ ùóØùóÆùóπùóÆùóªùó∞ùó≤ùòÄ ùó∂ùóªùóªùóºùòÉùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùòÑùó∂ùòÅùóµ ùó∞ùóºùóªùòÅùóøùóºùóπ. TACO acknowledges that governance, data, and operational sustainability are just as important as technological capability. Without these, agents become another unscalable AI experiment.\n\nKudos to Swami Chandrasekharan from KPMG for bringing clarity to this space. As the enterprise AI landscape evolves, frameworks like TACO will separate hype from real transformation. AI agents aren‚Äôt just the future‚Äîthey‚Äôre already here. The difference will be in how ùó∞ùóºùó∫ùóΩùóÆùóªùó∂ùó≤ùòÄ ùó∂ùó∫ùóΩùóπùó≤ùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅ ùòÅùóµùó≤ùó∫ ùòÅùóµùóºùòÇùó¥ùóµùòÅùó≥ùòÇùóπùóπùòÜ, ùó≤ùó≥ùó≥ùó∂ùó∞ùó∂ùó≤ùóªùòÅùóπùòÜ, ùóÆùóªùó± ùóÆùòÅ ùòÄùó∞ùóÆùóπùó≤.\n\nWould love to hear‚Äîhow is your organization thinking about AI agents?

The promise of AGI in the 1950s was rooted in premises that have been disproven by real-world evidence but blindly adhered to by those making today‚Äôs AGI claims. Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

Ensure the models span awareness-to-close; qualified-to-close isn‚Äôt broad enough.\n\nDevote at least 15% of leadership meetings to FUTURE quarters and leverage predictive models to drive the discussion.\n\nAs you sit in month 1 or 2, use predictive models to evaluate the most likely outcomes in months 5, 6, 7, and beyond. Then, you can effectively evaluate the sales and marketing (S&M) investments that address predicted gaps.\n\nMake S&M investment decisions based on predictive models even the FP&A loves. YES, the FP&A team. I am talking about using real math!\n\nLet the math tell you where to spend‚Äìnot the loudest voice in the room.\n\nThe old way of closing gaps was to ask the CRO to do more. To find more. To sell more with existing resources. ‚ÄúGo get us a $1M deal.‚Äù\n\nThe new way is to be methodical and leverage predictive modeling to drive decision-making.\n\nTry it.

        "content": "Work travel tips (pt. 2)- Here is how I make the MOST out of work travel: \n\n1. I often book an extra day or two on my own dime when headed to a new place OR a city I love.\n\nFlights are covered and that expense doesn‚Äôt really change if I fly home on thursday night or saturday morning (in fact I can usually find a cheaper flight on the weekend because i‚Äôm not as particular about timing). You get to explore at a fraction of the cost of booking an independent trip.\n\n* obvi check with your manager but most remote roles don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre remote from your house or remote from a hotel if you get your work done\n\n\n\n2. Document everything.\n\nI have a written journal I bought on my first solo work trip in 2022 (shout outfor the recommendation) and I take that everywhere. I also started shooting more content and I document travel that way too (got a few nifty vids coming soon). So nice to look back on those memz.\n\n\n\n3. Be EXTRA on the ball when you‚Äôre on the road.\n\nI‚Äôve always seen work travel as a benefit, I love every opportunity to go somewhere to rep. But I‚Äôll admit it took me a while to realize that while I‚Äôm on the road I almost need to be more on my game than at home. You never want to be seen as someone who slacks off or can‚Äôt handle the pressure of travel & their role. I‚Äôm still not perfect at it but it‚Äôs always on my mind so I am always a candidate to go on work trips.\n\n\n\n\n** Bonus. We useat Apollo to book work travel. But the tool allows you to accrue points and get discounts for personal travel. I actually just booked a hotel in London for a discount AND used a cash reward through Navan for a trip later this year.\n\nIdk how they make money or why I get to double dip like that but I‚Äôm not complaining.\n\n\n\n\nAnyone have good hotel hacks for travel?\n\nI feel like flying I‚Äôve got down to a science but hotels I‚Äôm still finding what works.",

Travel light and make use of hotel laundry. Yes, it is expensive. But if it gets me through a week in Asia using a carry-on, it's worth it.\n2). Make time for exercise. If I have to get up at 4:30 AM, I do.\n3). Never think about your home time zone, unless you are scheduling a meeting. I never say, \"It's 1:00 AM for me right now.\" I force a mental reset to the local time zone.\n4). Ask trusted local sources (not hotel employees) where to eat. I commonly as, \"What restaurant do you take your family to for a great meal?\"\n5). Don't check bags unless you have to. Once you check a bag, your options to re-route diminish. If my flight is delayed, I want zero barriers to switching. (See #1.)\n6). Get the right credit cards, if you can. I have American Airlines and Marriott Bonvoy cards. The points are huge when it comes to family vacations.\n\nLastly, travel is awesome but doesn't replace time with family. I was an 80% travel road warrior when my children were toddlers. I don't dwell on the past, but I regret that. That is time you never get back.",
