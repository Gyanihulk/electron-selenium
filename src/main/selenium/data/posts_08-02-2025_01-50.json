It’s a high-load simulation designed to test onchain performance.\n\nEach “game” involves intensive calculations—tracking ball physics, collisions, and game logic—all processed onchain.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\n- Ethereum struggles with latency and heavy computations due to its gas limits.\n- Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum improve scalability but inherit EVM performance limits and come with fragmentation.\n\nOn the other hand...\n\nGear.exe is an Ethereum network extension that executes multiple simulations in a single block with near-zero gas fees and comes without fragmentation.\n\nThe Setup:\n\nWe tested the same simulation on:\n- Ethereum: Baseline test to measure performance and costs.\n- Arbitrum EVM: Cheaper, but same gas logic as Ethereum.\n- Arbitrum Nitro: Optimized with WASM, 1,000 iterations per block.\n- Gear.exe: Parallel execution of 16 games in a single Ethereum block.\n\nWhy Gear.exe stands out:\n\n- Runs 16 high-load simulations simultaneously in a single block.\n- Near-zero gas costs and and low latency for massive computations.\n- Drastically improved UX: avoids fragmentation and latency on user a side.\n- Fully compatible with Ethereum (MetaMask, Etherscan).\n- Network extension - value accrual on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nImagine the possibilities:\n\nThis simulation demonstrates that Gear.exe isn’t just for gaming—it’s a game-changer for any high-load computation on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n• DeFi protocols? Check.\n• Machine learning models? Check.\n• Real-time gaming? Check.\n\nAnd we kept the receipts to prove it:",

        "content": "If you’re an early stage startup between $250k-$1.5M/ARR, here’s how you comp your first sales hire:\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nEarly stage comp plans during ZIPR were insane.\n\n$300-400k OTEs with effective quotas of $250-400k/year were not uncommon.\n\nThis was driven by companies raising gobs of capital AND trying to compete with mature companies offering generous ramp times, draws, and big OTEs.\n\nIt’s a tricky situation for early founders.\n\nFounders don’t yet have the sales yield where a rep can bring in 5-6x their OTE in bookings. Yet, they still need to bring in top talent and pay close to market rate to attract them.\n\nSo what do you do?\n\nHere's how I would structure the first comp plan (shoutout Jason M. Lemkin):\n\nThe rep doesn’t get paid commission until they pay for themselves. Once they pay for themselves in terms of base salary, they start getting a hefty commission rate with accelerators.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nMarket rate for the type of a rep you need is ~$180k OTE or $90k/year base ($7.5k/mo). They do not make any commission until they close their first $7.5k/mo or $22.5k/quarter.\n\nOnce they go above that, they make a flat commission of all deals of 18% (this rate is based on rough goal of what you think is possible + getting right around the market rate).\n\nAssuming they can sell ~$600k/year (based on real historicals, not out of whack expectations based on other markets/companies), then they would end up making:\n\n$90k base\n$108k variable\n$198k total\n\nEquity should be a part of this plan but most early reps are joining for cash upside more than anything else.\n\nWHY I LIKE THIS PLAN:\n\nIt gives sellers a lot of upside – the best AEs know they should be able to maximize the revenue from each new lead or opportunity\n\nIt’s simple – complex comp plans are dangerous and ripe for gaming\n\nYou attract the right type of talent – ones that want to bet on themselves and see the upside in closing the next big deal, having the biggest quarter, etc.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF THE REP START CRUSHING IT:\n\nThe CEO of Qualtrics said he had 25 year olds making $500k/yr selling Qualtrics from his basement. They raised no money at the time so it was more evenly distributed toward variable comp.\n\nThe 4th and 5th rep are taking less risk and it should be much easier to sell with proven customers, reputable logos, and a bit of awareness. It’s completely reasonable for them to get a smaller % of every deal.\n\nWhat I’ve found is that you can use equity to get people aligned to long term goals while continuing to make a lot of cash. The best reps realize they can make a lot of money over time OR you get them into a management track with more equity and less cash upside.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n\nThe market has adjusted back to reality.\n\nThere are still deeply funded and extremely profitable companies that are hard to compete with.\n\nA straight forward, variable heavy plan with a lot of upside will attracts the right sales talent.\n\nThen, do everything humanly possible to keep them drowning in pipeline and excited.",

I do business so that I can do personal things.\n\nAnd I'm on Linkedin to support and help my business community with their companies and their lives.\n\nWith that said...\n\nMy little brother, Jacob Boswell, has cancer.\n\nI've lost my sister Ruth, my older brother, Ben, and my mother, Kristine - all died way too soon and left huge holes in my heart.\n\nWe are all praying that Jacob is spared and that an up-coming surgery will clean it out and that it will stop spreading.\n\nI love my brother.\n\nAs teens we loved going head to head with each other. Full on fist fights and brawls. It was great! \n\nBut we always gave bro-hugs afterwards and remained best friends.\n\nHe's supported me in tough times and I've supported him in tough times.\n\nThat's what brothers do for each other, right? \n\nWell, now he is in crisis. So many things have crashed on him at once.\n\nThe vial, horrible monster of cancer is just one thing... there are others.\n\nAs a family, we are doing everything we can for him.\n\nBut this got bigger than all of us.\n\nSo, we are asking for help from our extended community.\n\nEmotional, spiritual and financial support for Jacob.\n\nI'm asking you to help if and as you can.\n\nI'll put a link in the comments for full details or you can get QR code in the pictures.\n\nMy friends, business and life are much the same... both are about giving value to help our fellow humans solve their challenges and live better.\n\nI've no doubt that you serve and give in your sphere of influence. And if you can help here, I know Jacob and his family would really appreciate it.\n\nIf you do, please DM me so I can thank you properly.\n\nThank you and God bless you.",

Osmosis is a framework that helps your AI agents learn in real time (similar to DeepSeek R1’s post-training loop) in order to make them better, faster, and cheaper.\n\nWhen tested on the WebArena benchmark, 4o-mini + Osmosis was 60% more accurate on a first pass than 4o - a model 16X more expensive. This means that even on a first run, Osmosis already makes 4o-mini 25X+ more cost-effective than base 4o!\n\nandhave known each other for over a decade — Kasey previously co-founded and sold a gaming startup, while Andy was a tech lead at TikTok in charge of real-time data and recommendations infrastructure. With Osmosis, they're unlocking real-time learning for AI agents.\n\nCongrats to the team on the launch!\n\n",

        "content": "resilience+Rise Podcast: A conversation with Kal Dosanjh: Part 1\n\nFrom the Streets to Solutions:’s Mission to Empower Youth\n\nA single encounter with a 15-year-old struggling with addiction led to a powerful realization—these kids aren’t just statistics; they are products of their environment, in need of support and guidance.\n\nThis week on the Resilience+Rise podcast, we sit down with Kal Dosanjh, a veteran police officer with 25 years of service, including 8 years patrolling Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. His journey from witnessing the harsh realities of street life to creating impactful solutions is one you won’t want to miss.\n\nKal's story isn't just about law enforcement; it's about understanding the root causes of crime and creating real, lasting change.\n\nKal shares his experiences in one of North America's most challenging environments, describing the complex socio-economic factors that contribute to the open-air drug market and the cycle of violence. He talks about the \"perfect storm\" of social housing, mental health challenges, and organized crime that plagues the Downtown Eastside. But more importantly, he shares the pivotal moment that shifted his focus from reactive policing to proactive community building.\n\nThis realization led Kal to found the KidsPlay Foundation, a registered charity dedicated to providing youth with positive alternatives. He explains the six streams of KidsPlay's work – education, sports, mentorship, environment, clinical counseling, and community patrol – and shares inspiring stories of kids whose lives have been transformed. From educational field trips to sports programs and mentorship opportunities, KidsPlay offers a lifeline to vulnerable youth, helping them develop valuable skills and make positive choices. Kal's powerful \"mahout\" metaphor perfectly illustrates the importance of instilling positive values early in life.\n\nJoin me, Thomas Scaria, ultra-marathoner and resilience coach, as I talk with Kal about his incredible journey, the challenges facing inner-city youth, and the transformative power of hope and opportunity. This is a conversation that will leave you inspired and motivated to make a difference.\n\nTune in to the Resilience+Rise podcast now! (Full Podcast & connection in the comments)",

They wanted something that truly reflected their high standards, professionalism, and the deep empathy they bring to their clients.\nSo we got to work\n\n Visual storytelling over stock photos\nInstead of generic law-themed imagery, we leaned into editorial-style illustrations—visual metaphors that capture the emotional weight of legal challenges. The result? A site that feels human, empathetic, and unlike anything else in their industry.\n\n Bios that build trust\nMost lawyer bios read like resumes. We took a different approach, crafting narratives that highlighted the people behind the credentials. Because trust isn’t just about qualifications—it’s about connection.\n\n A seamless, modern user experience\nWe optimized the site for easy navigation, mobile performance, and accessibility, ensuring every visitor could quickly find what they needed—whether they were researching services or making a payment.\n\nThe results?\n️ 23.68% increase in average engagement time\n️ 39.8% increase in payment page views\n️ 30.65% increase in form submissions\n\nExperience is Everything.\nAs a digital agency, Happy Medium transforms businesses with digital-first solutions that put your customers and their experiences first.\n\nLearn more:",

I have had a career of more than 20 years within the company, where I held all the main positions from Strategic Planning to Business Development and Projects & Products. The cyber security field became important to me thanks to Elettronica’s intuition that the growth of cyberspace represented a new operational domain for coming conflicts.\n\nℹ️ What is the most appealing thing to you about working in cyber security?\n\nI see and appreciate the close correlation between the Defence sector and the subsequent extension to that of cyber security. This can happen because very often innovation in Aerospace and Defence anticipates innovation in the civil business. This is the reason why we founded Cy4Gate. I consider cyberspace the main challenging sector at this moment, every single personal, industrial and governmental activity is now impacted by cyber security\n\n Name a book/movie that has inspired you. Anything specific to cyber security that you would recommend?\n\n“Code: Debugging the Gender Gap”. This short movie offers a picture of the situation of women and girls in computing science in America, highlighting the lack of diversity and gender equality in the industry. At the same time, it presents strategies to change this, showing that society can gain a lot by having more women and minorities included in the STEM community\n\n I recommend you to follow her , like and comment on this post to share her example, and perhaps suggest others to showcase !\n\n>>> This profile is part of a series I’m publishing every other day in collaboration with @Women4Cyber Foundation, follow me to receive the next updates.",

But he decided to take the risk.\nThat startup was DocuSign.\nThe candidate became their first salesperson in Chicago and the Midwest.\nIt turned into a 10-year run, complete with countless deals closed and equity rewards that I’m sure were life-changing.\nLooking back, it’s a great reminder: big opportunities often look like risks at first.\nSometimes, you just have to bet on an idea, a team, or a vision—and see where it takes you.\nWhat’s a risk you took that paid off in a big way? I’d love to hear your stories in the comments.",

It wasn't just a cost-saving tactic.\n\nIt was also a labor-hour-increasing tactic because they were implicitly de-incentivizing vacation time while appearing to be a \"flexible culture.\"\n\nAnd it worked. I only ended up taking 2 real vacations during my 2 years at the company because I adopted a mindset of \"I can just take the PTO later.\"\n\nThat mindset followed me to future workplaces, where I would (wrongly) justify my lack of vacation as me being a \"team player.\"\n\nUntil it all finally caught up to me and I majorly burnt out a few months ago.\n\nWhether you're at a company that offers unlimited PTO or not, take it. Don't let Corporate America win this one.\n\n- someone who learned the hard way",

I agree that it's important for employees to take their vacation time and prioritize their well-being. In fact, studies have shown that taking time off can increase productivity and creativity. It's also important for companies to create a culture that encourages and supports taking time off. This can include setting clear expectations for PTO usage, providing resources for vacation planning, and leading by example by taking time off themselves.

        "content": "What did I create?\n\nI developed a new AI system called Convergent Hierarchical Reasoning (CHR). Think of CHR as a “super brain” that combines four different thinking strategies into one neat package. Instead of having separate parts for different tasks, CHR brings them all together so the computer can process complex problems more smoothly and clearly.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nMany organizations, especially in government and defense, need AI systems that are fast, reliable, and easy to understand. Traditional AI systems are like having several independent experts who don’t always communicate well with each other—this can lead to delays, mistakes, and extra costs. CHR is important because it reduces these problems by unifying all the reasoning into one system. This makes it easier to audit (check for errors), secure (protect from breaches), and maintain (keep running efficiently), which is critical for high-stakes tasks.\n\nWhat is it capable of doing?\n\nBreaking Down Problems: CHR uses a method called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to split complex problems into simple, clear steps.\n\nExploring Multiple Options: With Forest-of-Thought (FoT), it examines many possible solutions at once, ensuring the best path is chosen.\n\nOrganizing Decisions: It uses the Trilevel Reasoning Graph (TRG) to organize its thinking into big-picture (strategic), mid-level (tactical), and detailed (operational) decisions.\n\nHandling Lots of Data Efficiently: Finally, Logarithmic Memory Networks (LMNs) help CHR manage large amounts of information quickly without using too many resources.\n\nOverall Summary:\n\nCHR is a powerful, unified AI framework designed to simplify and improve complex decision-making processes. By combining multiple advanced reasoning techniques into one system, it can make decisions faster, more accurately, and at a lower cost. This makes it especially valuable for critical applications like government training, military planning, or cybersecurity, where transparency, security, and efficiency are key. In short, CHR is like having one super-efficient, super-smart brain that is easier to manage and trust than a group of separate, less coordinated systems.\n\nClick Link Below to Read Research Paper:",

Schedule dedicated study blocks (2-3 hours max).\n2. Practice daily mindfulness or meditation (10-15 mins).\n3. Set clear boundaries between study and personal time.\n4. Use the Pomodoro technique (25 mins work, 5 mins rest).\n5. Track your energy levels and adjust your workload accordingly.\n6. Create a weekly self-care routine (exercise, hobbies, friends).\n7. Connect with Boom’s AI counseling for personalized support.\n\nHow to implement this system:\n• Block 2 hours daily for exercise and relaxation.\n• Use Boom’s check-ins to monitor emotions and stress.\n• Set realistic academic goals each semester.\n• Make time for social connections.\n• Plan your week every Sunday.\n\nThis simple system helped me maintain a 3.8 GPA at\nwhile preserving my mental health.\n\nThe key takeaway: Prioritize both grades and well-being, not one over the other. A balanced approach is sustainable long-term.\n\n Your mental health matters as much as your academic success. Reach out for support when needed—it’s always okay to ask for help.\n\nJoin the 100,000 students already trusting",

That’s why I appreciate’s TACO Framework (Taskers, Automators, Collaborators, Orchestrators)—a practical, structured way to think about enterprise AI adoption. <link below>\n\nHere’s why this approach resonates with me:\n\n1️⃣ 𝗜𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀. Instead of vague, overhyped promises, TACO provides a structured way to assess what agents can actually do today and where they’re headed.\n\n2️⃣ 𝗜𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀. Businesses don’t need “super agents” overnight. They need pragmatic, high-impact automation that solves real problems, starting with Taskers and Automators before scaling.\n\n3️⃣ 𝗜𝘁 𝗯𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹. TACO acknowledges that governance, data, and operational sustainability are just as important as technological capability. Without these, agents become another unscalable AI experiment.\n\nKudos to Swami Chandrasekharan from KPMG for bringing clarity to this space. As the enterprise AI landscape evolves, frameworks like TACO will separate hype from real transformation. AI agents aren’t just the future—they’re already here. The difference will be in how 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘆, 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲.\n\nWould love to hear—how is your organization thinking about AI agents? ",

Key examples:\n\n-Premise: language is the source of intelligence\n-Reality: intelligence is the source of language - babies are intelligent before they can speak\n\n-Premise: data is a representation of the real world\n-Reality: data is the output of a machine and represents only what the machine was designed to capture\n\n-Premise: the brain constructs objects by identifying frequent patterns of object bits\n-Reality: the brain contains networks of abstract concept cells which fire when the concepts are presented in diverse versions and formats (text, image, sound, etc.)\n\n-Premise: neural networks imitate how the brain reasons by processing massive data exhaustively\n-Reality: the brain computes the relevance of inputs using inhibition networks, filtering out over 99.99% of sensory data\n\nThere are more, but the point is that the main objectives of curation are:\n1-Ensure that knowledge from all relevant domains is included in the ontology\n2-Map the relevant knowledge concepts across the domains to problem and solution concepts\n3-Maintain the landscape concepts (science, business, regulation, etc.) reasonably updated\n\nTo enable these objectives, the custodian systems must support:\n1-Biomimetic digital twinning of problem and solution concepts\n2-Independent update by authorized experts\n2-Simulation and testing of the impact of proposed updates across the ontology architecture\n\nThe methodology and technology to build this type of biomimetic digital twin ecosystem exist, we have produced published results, and I have discussed this in my posts.\n\nThe vision of the Agentic Expertise Ecosystem in the image, however, is in early stages and will require committed partners with the necessary resources who want to participate in shaping the implementation of this new paradigm.",

        "content": "I’ve worked with some of the world’s largest companies to build annual plans. Tell me if this sounds familiar…\n\nIt is month 1 or 2 of the new fiscal year – and you are already in trouble.\n\nYou are in danger of missing the annual plan and aren’t entirely sure why.\n\nThe next Executive Leadership or Board Meeting is already on your worry list.\n\nYou’re unsure how to change the dynamic because your perspective on the business is limited. You are focused on the current month and quarter.\n\nYour plan has devolved into, “If I can make 1Q, I will figure out the rest later.”\n\nHere is a better idea.\n\nInvest in predictive models that highlight likely gaps-to-goal 12+ months into the future. Ensure the models span awareness-to-close; qualified-to-close isn’t broad enough.\n\nDevote at least 15% of leadership meetings to FUTURE quarters and leverage predictive models to drive the discussion.\n\nAs you sit in month 1 or 2, use predictive models to evaluate the most likely outcomes in months 5, 6, 7, and beyond. Then, you can effectively evaluate the sales and marketing (S&M) investments that address predicted gaps.\n\nMake S&M investment decisions based on predictive models even the FP&A loves. YES, the FP&A team. I am talking about using real math!\n\nLet the math tell you where to spend–not the loudest voice in the room.\n\nThe old way of closing gaps was to ask the CRO to do more. To find more. To sell more with existing resources. “Go get us a $1M deal.”\n\nThe new way is to be methodical and leverage predictive modeling to drive decision-making.\n\nTry it. Looking farther into the future and taking action is way more fun than sticking your head into the ground.",

While it’s essential for creating fair and thriving workplaces, there are many myths about what it actually involves.\n\nPlane crashes not withstanding, here are 10 things DEI isn’t:\n\n Lowering performance standards – DEI is about fairness, not about giving anyone an unfair advantage.\n\n Only about race – It also covers gender, disability, LGBTQ+ inclusion, socioeconomic background, and more.\n\n Forcing people to agree on everything – DEI encourages open dialogue and respect for different perspectives, not groupthink.\n\n Excluding majority groups – Men, white people, and non-disabled employees are still included in DEI efforts.\n\n Blaming individuals for systemic issues – DEI work is about changing policies and cultures, not pointing fingers.\n\n A one-time training – Real DEI change requires long-term commitment, not just a one-off workshop.\n\n Political indoctrination – DEI is about fairness and workplace culture, not pushing a political agenda.\n\n Just an HR initiative – It should be embedded into every part of a company’s operations and leadership decisions.\n\n A marketing tactic – True DEI is about real change, not just a corporate diversity statement for public relations.\n\n A guarantee of perfect harmony – DEI fosters equity, but workplaces will still require effort to navigate differences respectfully.\n\n DEI is about ensuring everyone has a fair shot at success – not special treatment, not exclusion, and not a shortcut to diversity quotas.\n\nLet’s move beyond the myths and focus on what truly drives inclusion and equity in our workplaces.\n\nWhat other DEI myths have you heard?

        "content": "Work travel tips (pt. 2)- Here is how I make the MOST out of work travel: \n\n1. I often book an extra day or two on my own dime when headed to a new place OR a city I love.\n\nFlights are covered and that expense doesn’t really change if I fly home on thursday night or saturday morning (in fact I can usually find a cheaper flight on the weekend because i’m not as particular about timing). You get to explore at a fraction of the cost of booking an independent trip.\n\n* obvi check with your manager but most remote roles don’t care if you’re remote from your house or remote from a hotel if you get your work done\n\n\n\n2. Document everything.\n\nI have a written journal I bought on my first solo work trip in 2022 (shout outfor the recommendation) and I take that everywhere. I also started shooting more content and I document travel that way too (got a few nifty vids coming soon). So nice to look back on those memz.\n\n\n\n3. Be EXTRA on the ball when you’re on the road.\n\nI’ve always seen work travel as a benefit, I love every opportunity to go somewhere to rep. But I’ll admit it took me a while to realize that while I’m on the road I almost need to be more on my game than at home. You never want to be seen as someone who slacks off or can’t handle the pressure of travel & their role. I’m still not perfect at it but it’s always on my mind so I am always a candidate to go on work trips.\n\n\n\n\n** Bonus. We useat Apollo to book work travel. But the tool allows you to accrue points and get discounts for personal travel. I actually just booked a hotel in London for a discount AND used a cash reward through Navan for a trip later this year.\n\nIdk how they make money or why I get to double dip like that but I’m not complaining.\n\n\n\n\nAnyone have good hotel hacks for travel?\n\nI feel like flying I’ve got down to a science but hotels I’m still finding what works.",

Travel light and make use of hotel laundry. Yes, it is expensive. But if it gets me through a week in Asia using a carry-on, it's worth it.\n2). Make time for exercise. If I have to get up at 4:30 AM, I do.\n3). Never think about your home time zone, unless you are scheduling a meeting. I never say, \"It's 1:00 AM for me right now.\" I force a mental reset to the local time zone.\n4). Ask trusted local sources (not hotel employees) where to eat. I commonly as, \"What restaurant do you take your family to for a great meal?\"\n5). Don't check bags unless you have to. Once you check a bag, your options to re-route diminish. If my flight is delayed, I want zero barriers to switching. (See #1.)\n6). Get the right credit cards, if you can. I have American Airlines and Marriott Bonvoy cards. The points are huge when it comes to family vacations.\n\nLastly, travel is awesome but doesn't replace time with family. I was an 80% travel road warrior when my children were toddlers. I don't dwell on the past, but I regret that. That is time you never get back.",
