        "content": "Renting Your Property? \n\nLearn How Accommodation Sharing Affects Your Taxes! \n\nWhether you‚Äôre renting out a room or an entire property, it's important to understand how income from accommodation sharing impacts your taxes.\n\nWhat is Accommodation Sharing?\n‚Ü≥ Accommodation sharing involves renting part or all of a property for a short period.\n‚Ü≥ This can include your primary or secondary residence.\n‚Ü≥ It also includes rentals facilitated by third-party platforms like Airbnb, CanadaStays, FlipKey, and VRBO.\n\nIncome Tax on Accommodation Sharing\n‚Ü≥ Any income you earn from accommodation sharing is subject to income tax.\n‚Ü≥ The CRA will classify this income as either rental income or self-employment business income, based on the services you provide to tenants.\n\nDetermining Rental or Business Income\n‚Ü≥ Rental Income: If you offer basic services, such as heat, utilities, parking, and laundry facilities, your income is generally considered rental income.\n‚Ü≥ Business Income: If you offer additional services like meals, cleaning, or security, your income is likely to be classified as self-employment business income.\nThe more services you provide, the more likely it is that your income will be treated as business income.\n\nExample of Rental Income vs. Business Income\n‚Ü≥ Charles: Rents out his property on Airbnb and includes meals, cleaning, and tour services. This would be considered business income.\n‚Ü≥ Ren√©e: Rents out a property and only provides basic services like accommodation, heat, and parking. This would generally be considered rental income.\n\nReporting Rental Income\n‚Ü≥ If your accommodation sharing income is considered rental income, you need to report it on your income tax return and complete Form T776, Statement of Real Estate Rentals.\n‚Ü≥ If it‚Äôs considered self-employment business income, report it on your income tax return and file Form T2125, Statement of Business or Professional Activities.\n\nDeducting Rental Expenses\n‚Ü≥ You can deduct reasonable expenses you incur to earn rental income.\n‚Ü≥ If you rent only part of a property, such as a room, you can only claim expenses related to the rented portion.\n\nGST/HST Obligations for Accommodation Sharing\n‚Ü≥ Short-term accommodations (less than 1 month) are subject to GST/HST. However, rentals lasting 1 month or more are exempt from this tax.\n‚Ü≥ If you earn more than $30,000 in gross revenue over four calendar quarters from accommodation sharing, you must register, collect, and remit GST/HST to the CRA.\n\nGST/HST Input Tax Credits (ITCs)\n‚Ü≥ If you register to collect GST/HST, even if your income is below $30,000, you can claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs).\n‚Ü≥ This allows you to reduce the amount of GST/HST you owe, similar to how you can deduct rental expenses for income tax purposes.\n\n\nClosing Tip\n‚Ü≥ Keep detailed records of all your rental income and related expenses. The CRA may ask to see these documents.\n\nHave questions or need assistance? Let‚Äôs connect! ",

It's alive in every decision you make, every policy you implement, and every person you hire.\n\nGen Z has shown us that purpose needs to flow through an organization like DNA - present in every cell, guiding every action.\n\nThey're looking for consistency, not perfection. Real effort, not polished statements.\n\nThis shift can make you a better marketer.\n\nA better business.\n\nA better leader.\n\nBecause when purpose moves from your mission statements into your daily decisions, something remarkable happens:\n\nYou build trust that lasts.",

And if you have not been FORMATTING it right, how will you pass stage 1 of the race?\n\nFix it now before it's too late.\n\nI'm here to help, here's how to do it right.\n\nÔ∏è Choose a clean layout\n\nGo for an uncomplicated and chronological template that is easy to comprehend and navigate.\n\n- Name & Contact\n- Education\n- Experience\n- Extra Curricular /Certifications\n- Skills\n\nÔ∏è Keep it concise\n\n- Short descriptions of your experience in pointers rather than writing in paragraphs.\n\n- Delete unnecessary information that is irrelevant to the role you're applying for.\n\n- Only include recent and remarkable work experience. Don't add any experience that is more than 4 years old.\n\nÔ∏è Let your resume breathe\n\n- Add tables for each heading.\n\n- Leave some space after the margins of the table lines, the borders and after each table.\n\n- Don't clutter the boxes with numerous pointers. Keep 2- 3 pointers at maximum.\n\nÔ∏è Make it ATS friendly\n\nTo save time, companies have resorted to running all your resumes through Applicant Tracking System or ATS.\n\nTo stand out, use keywords.\n\n- Directly from the job description.\n- Don't use keywords inappropriately, that is, out of context.\n- Don't overuse them.\n\nFor example:\nRequirement: HR Manager\n\nYour Experience:\n\nHR Executive at XYZ\n- Managed the recruitment and selection process\n- Supervised HR Coordinator and tracked the performance of employees\n- Improved employee satisfaction by 25% etc\n\nÔ∏è Follow reverse chronological order\n\n- Always start from your recent achievements/experience / educational qualification.\n\nFor example:\n\nSales Intern at XYZ\n- Led a team of 7 members and contributed to 40% of the raised funds for x event in June 2023\n- Converted 100+ leads in 2 weeks in April 2023\n\nSome Tips:\n\n Don't use different fonts and text colours. Stick to one font and size throughout.\nFor example, Times New Roman and size 12.\n\n Don't use bold or italics excessively. Only use it for headings.\n\n Use short sentences and bullet points.\n\n Limit your resume to 1 page only.\n\nLeave your best advice for anyone who's applying for a job in the comments. \n\nFollow",

Ability to understand the nuances of a given role and effectively take on the responsibilities and stewardship of the role, achieve results, and \"get it done\" seem to fit. For many positions this requires both emotional and intellectual intelligence. It may include investing in and supporting people willing to learn and grow into a given role (tightly aligned with accountability). In the military it may require a vow to follow orders without question, unless those orders become so egregious and morally bankrupt that individuals choose to stand down. A question to ponder: are there any circumstances where blind loyalty to a leader, company, party or cause are acceptable as one of the \"merits\" used to hire, fire, appoint and recommend people in the public or commercial sector?",

It‚Äôs about business outcomes.\n\nYet, we‚Äôve been caught in platform comparison wars‚ÄîAdobe Commerce vs. Magento vs. Shopify, BigCommerce vs. WooCommerce, headless vs. monolithic. Each side boasting features, flexibility, and scalability. But here‚Äôs the hard truth:\n 76% of eCommerce decision-makers say they prioritize revenue growth over platform capabilities. (Source: Forrester)\n Only 17% of merchants believe switching platforms significantly impacts customer experience. (Source: Baymard Institute)\n 85% of businesses consider security and compliance a top priority when choosing an eCommerce solution. (Source: Cybersecurity Ventures)\nFeatures don‚Äôt sell. Business results do.\n\nWhat truly matters for merchants?\n Growth ‚Äì More revenue, better margins.\n Efficiency ‚Äì Less friction, fewer headaches.\n Control ‚Äì Full ownership over their data and store operations.\n Security ‚Äì Protection against fraud, data breaches, and cyber threats.\n Easy Integration ‚Äì Seamless connections between ERP, CRM, payment gateways, and logistics.\n Quality of Work ‚Äì A stable, scalable platform that supports long-term growth without constant fixes.\n\neCommerce platforms are tools, not strategies. Merchants aren‚Äôt asking, \"Does this platform have X feature?\" They‚Äôre asking:\n \"Will this help me scale my business?\"\n \"Can I reach new customers?\"\n \"Will it make my operations smoother?\"\n \"Do I have full control over my store and customer data?\"\n \"How secure is my store against cyber threats?\"\n\nThe future of eCommerce isn‚Äôt about winning platform debates. It‚Äôs about delivering results. Whether it‚Äôs Adobe Commerce, Magento, BigCommerce, Shopify Plus, or headless solutions, the real question is: Which ecosystem empowers success while offering control, security, and easy integration?\n\nLet‚Äôs move beyond platform superiority and start focusing on merchant success. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?
