      "content": "Swiggy's Shark Tank India sponsorship this season is turning pitches into impulse buys (and I fell for it!)\n\nAs I was watching the show, I noticed something fascinating: whenever a product was being pitched, Swiggy flashed a message saying it was available onfor delivery within 10 minutes. Curious, I opened the app to check it out‚Äîand ended up adding it  , just like any other curious consumer!\n\nIn fact, theapp even has a dedicated landing page with a clickable module showcasing products featuring Shark Tank products from every season - pretty impressive, convenient and catchy in my opinion! (see pic)\n\nThat‚Äôs when it hit me: Swiggy isn‚Äôt just aiming for brand visibility here. This is a well-crafted business and marketing strategy, and here‚Äôs why it works:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ It drives app engagement. People like me, intrigued by the pitches, head straight to the Swiggy app to explore. A specific landing page also really helps other brands of previous seasons.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ It triggers impulse purchases. The excitement from the pitch nudges viewers to buy immediately.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ It increases Instamart‚Äôs basket size. Once you‚Äôre on the app, you‚Äôre more likely to shop for other things you need, sticking to Swiggy over Blinkit or Zepto.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ It uses exclusive access smartly. As a Shark Tank sponsor, Swiggy likely knows the products being pitched well in advance, giving them a first-mover advantage in listing these items.\n\n Given the rising use, adaptability and convenience of quick commerce for Indian consumers, this sponsorship will definitely have positive yields for Swiggy and the listed brands.\n\nOnly 3 episodes in, and I might‚Äôve already gone a little overboard with my orders! How about you? Did you give in to the impulse buys yet? ",

      "content": " The Future of B2B Cross-Border Payments: 2025 and Beyond\n\nThe B2B cross-border payments landscape is on the brink of a seismic shift. With the sector projected to hit $56.1 trillion by 2030, the demand for faster, smarter, and more transparent payment solutions has never been greater. As we step into 2025, here are the trends set to transform this space:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Payments: Speed and transparency are non-negotiable. Networks like FedNow and Faster Payments are paving the way for 24/7 global transactions, minimizing friction and redefining settlement expectations.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Interoperability is Key: Seamlessly connecting local payment rails will accelerate money movement, especially in regions like Southeast Asia, where cross-border integrations are gaining momentum.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Driven Innovation: From predictive analytics to fraud detection, AI is revolutionizing efficiency and security in payments. Generative AI will be a game-changer in 2025.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Transparency & Tracking: Businesses demand real-time visibility into payment flows. Providers that prioritize tracking capabilities and actionable data will stand out.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Regulatory Harmonization: Initiatives like PSD3 and ISO 20022 are streamlining standards, fostering smoother, more secure international transactions.\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Local Currency Settlements: More businesses are opting for local currencies to cut exchange costs and simplify cross-border operations.\n\nThe future of B2B payments is about collaboration, customer-centricity, and cutting-edge tech. Whether you're an innovator in fintech, a decision-maker in global trade, or simply curious about the evolution of payments, the conversation around real-time solutions and transparency is one we can‚Äôt afford to ignore.\n\n What trend excites you the most, and how do you see it shaping global business in 2025?

      "content": "I can never forget the Great Smog of Delhi in 2016. I grew up in the capital city. I knew we had a pollution problem. I was reporting on it for The Hindu. \n\nBut that November was different. For the first time, we could see it, smell it, and viscerally feel what is always around and often remains invisible: the deadly pollution in our air.\n\nI wrote a lot and made cool (though not inspiring) charts. I wanted to figure out what was happening to the city I call home‚Äîand how we would get out of this catastrophe. The more I understood, the more the complexity of the problem revealed itself. It wasn't about one department, or one state, or one Chief Minister. This required center-state coordination, huge resources, long-term planning‚Äîand us. We are both victims and perpetrators.\n\nSo when the National Clean Air Programme was launched in 2019, it felt like progress. And it felt personal. For one, the scale of the crisis was finally acknowledged. And two, investment from the center matched ambition. It had promise.\n\nThe latest story in The Plank‚Äîour new long-form magazine‚Äîshows how this plan is getting derailed. It's a clue to understanding why India struggles to clean its air.\n\nMy colleagueand I spent many weeks reading government documents, analysing data, and interviewing scientists and officials working in air quality to report this story. We entered with the only question that every clueless journalist (us, here) must ask: What's going on?\n\nThat discovery process led us to uncover an architecture of selective measurement. There's no lying here, no corruption, no data fudging‚Äînot that we know of. It's not even about incompetence or lack of resources.\n\nIf there's a scandal, it's one of choice: the system has created an elaborate way to look like it's solving problems‚Äîa system designed to engineer ignorance.\n\nThe details are in our story. Please read. Link in comments below.\n\nPS: If you work in air quality, we want to get feedback. Really. If we have missed any key perspective in our reporting or there are areas which deserve more attention, please DM or write to me at. Because a story is not finished when we press publish. We will update and follow up to take this forward.",
