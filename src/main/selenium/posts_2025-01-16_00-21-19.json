      "content": "What if I knew then what I know now? \n\nIf you've ever wished you could run your hands through the river of time, catching fragments of the life you've already lived, then you’ve felt the ache of avenoir.\n\nAvenoir is one of those hauntingly beautiful words from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows — the bittersweet desire to see where you’ve been, to watch your past unfold before you like a film, scene by scene.\n\nImagine you are standing at the edge of your timeline. What would you say to the younger versions of yourself—the dreamer, the risk-taker, the heartbroken?\n\nWould you cheer them on, warn them, or simply watch, mesmerized by the unfolding story of your life?\n\nThe ache of avenoir—longing to look back and rewrite our story with the wisdom we’ve gained in the present—can be overwhelming.\n\nHowever, if we didn’t experience both sides of the polarity spectrum, how would we truly appreciate the human experience?\n\nThe grand design of the universe is no accident. In this third-dimensional reality, where time and space are our constructs, we experience life in a linear fashion.\n\nEach moment builds on the last, forcing us to move forward, whether we’re ready or not. While quantum physics reveals a reality where all timelines run concurrently, we live through the lens of time, experiencing life step by step in the physical for reasons known only to the forces that set this world in motion billions of years ago.\n\nWe may long for the clarity of hindsight at the moment, but without the lessons learned through pain, joy, failure, and triumph, the wisdom we cherish now simply wouldn’t exist.\n\nDespite what some may say, this linear journey is not a punishment; it’s a gift. A chance to evolve in ways only the limitations of time can teach us.\n\nTherefore, if you find yourself longing for a do-over, remember this: the heartbreaks taught you about the power of love, the mistakes showed you the grace of humility, and the moments of triumph proved you’re capable of anything and everything you set your mind to.\n\nSo, the next time you feel the pull of avenoir, remember that the story behind you is as it's meant to be. And like any great tale, perhaps it’s here to teach us that life isn’t meant to be perfect—it’s meant to be lived.\n\nKeep Shining ⭐\n©Angelique Letizia",

      "content": "BIG BULLIES, SMALL... \n\nWanted to share a small incident from our building's clubhouse today with our son, Risshan. Most will know him from his big singing voice, bigger smile.\n\nBeing on the autism spectrum, social communication is often an issue. He has experienced bullying on several occasions, usually by kids who didn't know better, *until* they were explained. So someone *always* accompanies him. Of course, there are also some wonderful, kids and adults who go _out of their way_ to be kind to him.\n\nToday wasn't that day.\n\nHe plays squash every Tue/ Thu. But given his attention-deficit, a lot of time goes standing/ twitching... his tool to calm his social anxiety. But on OUR booking time.\n\nHe was accompanied by his grandmother today when another gentleman claimed he had a booking [he very well knew, he didn't, and the guard showed him ours], so he then proceeded to ask her to ask Rissh to step out as, \"he's anyway doing timepass\".\nAnd then with a couple other folks, wanted to go in to play along \"so he can learn\".\n\nGiven the crap network, grandma couldn't reach me to intervene but fortunately she told them off. After which they *grudgingly* went away.\n\nI guess it takes all kinds to make this world [and our society] the place it is. Fortunately the kind ones outnumber the others.\n\nI run free sessions on inclusion. And time spent with Rissh could teach them a thing or two on kindness. Here's wishing them a happy 2025 [and may their lack of awareness/ acceptance/ sensitivity get, erm, squash-ed].\n\n#\n\n\nPs: I'm so proud of my self-restraint, with both, my words and actions. My thoughts, however... BWUHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAA!",
