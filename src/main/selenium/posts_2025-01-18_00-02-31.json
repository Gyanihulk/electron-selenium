Head of Social Growth\n\nNot your typical social media person. Think deeper.\n\n- Someone who instinctively gets what makes content spread\n- Can watch any viral hit and extract the invisible patterns\n- Transforms those patterns into your brand's advantage\n\nThe hiring truth no one tells you:\n\n- Find the solo founders crushing their own brand right now\n- They're quietly building their app or ecomm empire\n- Start with a part-time poach (they're all in founder Discords)\n- But you need serious vision to pull them in\n\n2. Creator Manager (The Scientific Engine)\n\nThis is your optimization architect who:\n\n- Lives in the daily content trenches\n- Treats every post like a scientific experiment\n- Surgically adjusts hooks until they hit\n- Builds systems for virality, not random posting\\\n\n3. Talent Scout (The Scale Engine)\n\nThis person is all about pure systematic execution:\n\n- Scales creator outreach to thousands\n- Masters data extraction and pipeline building\n- Turns recruiting into a repeatable machine\n- Builds VA systems that actually work\n\nHere's what everyone gets wrong:\n\nThese are three completely different brains.\n\nThat magical hire who can do it all?\n\nThey don't exist.\n\nEither build this team or do the work yourself.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth:\n\nThis isn't optional anymore.\n\nThis isn't something agencies can solve.\n\nThis is your new moat.",

Instead of wasting years chasing VC funding and \"massive\" exits, most founders should focus on one goal: bootstrapping to $3M ARR. Here’s how I grew my first $3M ARR startup into a $25M ARR SaaS with $12M in profit (without giving up control):\n\nCompany 1: Robly Email Marketing\n\nMy first startup was a bootstrapped email newsletter app. We got it to $3m ARR by going after Constant Contact customers with a cheaper/better offer (for a $40/mo product!).\n\nThat only got us about 1% of their revenue, but fortunately we kept the team tiny, and were left with positive cashflow to keep building.\n\nCompany 2: GetEmails (now):\n\nStarted as a feature in Robly. People were using the feature (called RoblyID), downloading the file, putting it in Klaviyo, and said it was awesome.\n\nWe spun it out, funded it with the cash coming off Robly, and despite being stuck several times along the way, it’s now over $20m ARR… And we ended up selling Robly for $10m to private equity.\n\nCompany 3:\n\nRB2B was the result ofpushing me to create a GetEmails for B2B. Before RB2B, company-level ID existed, but not person-level. Now, we have around 20 competitors, including ZoomInfo.\n\nWe used the cashflow from Retention to get it off the ground, went $0-$4m ARR in 40 weeks, and it’s nicely positive cashflow (albeit stuck).\n\nWhen you stack RB2B on Retention it’s a 40 person team with $25m ARR and $12m run-rate profit.\n\nSounds like a dream business.\n\nExcept that we’re stuck again...\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n\nI don’t know why more people don’t follow the path I took.\n\nStart small and profitable, then take bigger and bigger swings.\n\nYou’ll learn valuable lessons and become incredibly skilled when the stakes are low, so that when the stakes are higher, you can swing that much harder.\n\nRemember:\n\nYou're not Steve Jobs.\nYou're not Travis Kalanick.\nYou're not Parker Conrad.\n\nNeither am I.\n\nThat's OK.\n\nStart small.\n\nThen go bigger and BIGGER as the journey progresses.",

However, they differ significantly in approach, depth of representation, and use cases. Let’s break it down using two example sentences:\n\nSentence 1: \"What is the price of apple?\"\nSentence 2: \"What is the revenue of Apple?\"\n\n𝗧𝗘𝗫𝗧 𝗩𝗘𝗖𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗜𝗭𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡:\nText vectorizers (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF) process sentences by counting word occurrences or analyzing word frequencies.\n\nExample Output:\n- Vocabulary: [what, is, the, price, of, apple, revenue]\n- Sentence 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n- Sentence 2: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nExplanation: Both sentences treat \"apple\" the same way. The vectorizer doesn’t know if \"apple\" refers to a fruit or a company—it only counts the word’s occurrences.\n\n𝗧𝗘𝗫𝗧 𝗘𝗠𝗕𝗘𝗗𝗗𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗦:\nEmbeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) create contextualized word representations by analyzing the relationships between words within a sentence.\n\nExample Output:\n- Sentence 1: Embedding understands that \"price\" relates to products → Apple = fruit\n- Sentence 2: Embedding understands that \"revenue\" refers to business → Apple = company\n\nExplanation: Embeddings use surrounding words (\"price\" vs. \"revenue\") to determine the meaning of \"Apple\" in each sentence. This context-aware understanding comes from models trained on vast datasets with billions of parameters.\n\n𝗞𝗘𝗬 𝗗𝗜𝗙𝗙𝗘𝗥𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘𝗦:\n\n- Text Vectorization: Simple, context-agnostic; treats words independently. Not trained; relies on mathematical representation. Best for classification tasks, keyword matching, etc.\n\n- Text Embeddings: Advanced, context-aware, adapts meaning based on surrounding words. Trained on large data corpora with billions of parameters. Ideal for chatbots, sentiment analysis, language translation, and other complex NLP tasks.\n\n\nFollowfor more such content! ",
