      "content": "LAYOFFS AND THE BRIDGE JOB YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE\n\nI'm not cut out for this...\n\nWithin two hours of starting the job, I knew that I made a mistake.\n\nSeverance and the meager unemployment I was getting paid was running out and I needed to generate cash flow quickly. Devoid of any real options, I applied and was hired for a position at luxury car dealership as a salesperson.\n\nI felt sleezy.\n\nSurrounded by men in bad suits wearing cufflinks so large you could eat a plate of nachos off of them, I was a sheep amongst wolves, naive to the ways of screwing people over in pursuit of profit.\n\nIt was the early 2000s and times were flush with dotcom money. Internet millionaires were thick as a swarm of mosquitos and stay at home moms flocked the showroom floor to secure bragging rights for the school drop off line.\n\nWhat you do for a buck.\n\nI was embarrassed and worried every day that I would bump into someone that I knew. I didn't want to be judged and be perceived as a failure.\n\nHell, a handful of months earlier, I was working with the Chinese Ministry of Finance and today I was selling the virtues of European engineering and pushing overpriced extended warranties in the hope I could squeeze an extra $200 out of the deal.\n\nThis wasn't how my life was supposed to turn out.\n\nWhen you get laid off, survival is the order of the day. You're forced to make decisions you wouldn't have considered previously if the circumstances were different.\n\nTaking an hourly job or side hustle doesn't replace even a fraction of what you once made, but groceries aren't cheap and your gas tank isn't going to fill itself. That coffee from Dunks is now considered a luxury and just forget about splurging on a ribeye at $27.99 a pound from the butcher shop.\n\nThe situation may be temporary when you take on a bridge job, but you don't know that at the time.\n\nIt seems like your life hit a brick wall and your new reality will be fueled by nothing more than desperation, stress and worry. Squeezed by self doubt, external market conditions and a dwindling bank account, you really aren't living your life, but surviving it.\n\nAnd, nothing more.\n\nYour situation will eventually change, but you're never quite sure when it will happen. Will it be a month or will this state of suspended animation get drawn out to a year or more?\n\nIt really doesn't matter.\n\nYou can only control what you can control.\n\nSometimes, that means taking a bridge job you hate as much as the IRS, swallowing your pride and being thankful to make $20/hr rather than minimum wage.\n\nIf you're lucky to find one at all.\n\nBELIEVE IN YOURSELF AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IN YOU!",

Another quick update from the Deel onboarding diaries…\n\nIt’s uncomfy at times!!\n\nAs sellers we really really like to know what we are talking about, or at least pretend to know what we are talking about.\n\nBut when you are a brand new hire, at a brand new company, within a new industry, with a new product… you can feel like a lost child at times.\n\nAnd sellers reeaaallly don’t like that feeling.\n\nBut what I’ve come to learn in my old age is, that feeling of discomfort is ok. It’s expected. It’s normal.\n\nAnd it’s not an indication of your future success in the role.\n\nSo get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable and it really makes the whole onboarding experience a whole lot easier.\n\nBe a sponge with an open mind, and you’ll be surprised at how much you learn in 1-2 months time.\n\nAlmost enough to feel like you know what you are taking about… almost.\n\nTo anyone else out there feeling like the new kid on the block and like they don’t know where to sit in the cafeteria, I’m right there with you.\n\nAnd I promise, we will be ok.\n\n- Nik the newbie deeler",

      "content": "32 posts ignored. 2 months of poor engagement. 7 times I almost quit posting on LinkedIn.\n 4 months later, I signed up a client worth $3,500. No premium account. No cold outreach.\n\nHere’s exactly what changed in those 5 months:\n\n>> A year ago, I thought talking only about my 0-1 story, setbacks, and wins would set me apart. Wrong.\nThe moment I shifted from just personal updates to also sharing tips, ideas, and strategies about the industry I’m in, everything changed.\n\nOn a call with the first client I landed through LinkedIn, they said: \"I already know the quality of your work, so we can jump right into it.\"\n\nMy profile had become my branding agency,’s portfolio.\n\n>> Switched from casual pictures to professionally shot pictures. A small change but with a massive impact on credibility.\n\n>> I made sure to share my perspectives on trending branding and design news.\nThis positionedas one that stays ahead of industry trends and understands current market dynamics.\n\n>> I stopped obsessing over quality and made it a point to post 4-5 times every week.\nJust consistent, valuable content helped me grow to 11k followers, leading to:\n\n- Speaking at industry podcasts\n- Hosting branding webinars\n- Building strong agency partnerships\n- Creating genuine industry connections\n\nSo, if you’re a founder or business owner struggling with social media:\n\n> Choose a platform and start creating. Don’t quit early, thinking, “Maybe this isn’t working.”\n\n> Plan a strategy and execute it for at least 3 months.\n\n> If your strategy doesn’t yield the desired results in the first quarter, revisit your Notion board.\n\n> Commit to 6–12 months of consistent effort.\n\nThe key? Stay the course, learn from the process, and watch your efforts compound over time.",

I'm sure you would agree with me that if you do most of your work virtually being in person with the people you partner with is always great.\n\nI also got the opportunity to be with other clients in person that I had never met outside of zoom meeting.\n\nandit was great seeing you in person and there are clearly more in-person good times that are in our future!\n\nI forgot to take a pic with you both or it would have made it to that part of this post!",
