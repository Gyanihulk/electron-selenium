      "content": "Here are 7 public speaking \"myths\" you should stop believing.\n\nThese come up all the time with my clients → let's bust them today!\n\n1. You need to be born a great speaker\nTruth: Speaking is a skill you can learn, just like riding a bike.\n\n2. Only extroverts are good speakers\nTruth: Many introverts are AMAZING speakers because they prepare so well.\n\n3. You can’t make mistakes\nTruth: Mistakes make you human. Audiences care more about your message than perfection.\n\n4. You have to memorize everything\nTruth: Knowing your key points is enough, don’t aim for a word-for-word script.\n\n5. You have to use big, fancy words\nTruth: Simple language connects better with everyone.\n\n6. I don't need public speaking\nTruth: Everyone uses public speaking to speak to friends, colleagues, and even families. Public speaking is communicating with at least 1 person daily.\n\n7. Great speakers never feel scared\nTruth: Even pros get nervous, they just know how to channel it into excitement.\n\n7 truths to speak with confidence:\n\n1. Practice out loud, not just in your head.\n2. Start small, and speak in front of friends or colleagues.\n3. Focus on helping your audience, not on being perfect.\n4. Use pauses to think, it’s powerful, not awkward.\n5. Smile and make eye contact, it builds trust.\n6. Use stories, they’re memorable and engaging.\n7. Remember, every great speaker starts as a beginner.\n\nBonus: Be kind to yourself. Growth takes time, but it’s worth it. ️\n\nSpeaking is for everyone. Now’s your time to shine.\n\n(Feel free to share this if it helps you!) ️",

But honestly, it's not everyday you get to work with people as passionate, dedicated, collaborative, and fun as the Marrders.\n\nNot to mention, their product isn't something people just say is \"innovative\". It truly is changing the game - and if I were a gambling man... it will be one of the next huge brands to come from Utah.\n\n\nOh - and a humble brag:\nI think it's clear to say baby Matthew likes me the most.
