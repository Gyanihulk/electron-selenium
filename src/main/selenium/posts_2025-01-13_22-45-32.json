      "content": "Sigh. The anti-TDD movement (if we can call it that) is quite tiresome.\n\nAsking what examples of enterprise software TDD logic is used for is like asking which type of medium you are going to use for your art.\n\nIt can be any kind of business rule not just a simple boolean. I couldn‚Äôt tell you whether X or Y is the business rule we‚Äôre talking about.\n\nI was recently asked.\n\n‚ÄúDo I realise the difference between TDD and automated testing‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôve been developing for 20 years. I first was taught TDD practices 14 years ago. We used it exclusively to build a warehouse management solution forand I‚Äôve used the practise successfully at numerous major FTSE 100 orgs.\n\nTHG company listed for $7 billion on the London Stock Exchange when it IPO‚Äôd. So clearly it works. Many businesses have been built off the back of TDD best practices. Many have won awards.\n\nI‚Äôve taught TDD first principles to room of 30-40 software engineers at the BBC and Booking and it‚Äôs a practise that needs to be honed just like any other.\n\nNo one is stopping you from designing software up front. No one is stopping you from building prototypes but then reverting to TDD when you understand the design means you can reduce bloat and simplify solutions. You only write the code you need and know regressions are covered.\n\nIf you write tests afterwards how do you know you won‚Äôt get false positives? How do you know your bugs are covered? How do you refactor complex software safely without lots of manual testing if there are holes that aren‚Äôt covered?\n\nMillions of software engineers successfully use TDD every day.\n\nAnti-TDD advocates are basically saying that because they don‚Äôt like hammers and it doesn‚Äôt work for them, other engineers shouldn‚Äôt use hammers. TDD is a paradigm and approach that works for some software engineers, helps them build more rigour into the software code they write.\n\nI can‚Äôt count how many times tests have caught me in complex refactors. Tests that should in no way have failed but did.\n\n‚ÄúTo err is human‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt understand the argument that if you‚Äôre some god engineer then you don‚Äôt need tests or to write tests first. Great for you - God engineer but most people aren‚Äôt superhuman. Most engineers make mistakes and we use TDD as an approach to make us better at the craft.\n\nI get that some people don‚Äôt enjoy TDD but I find this attitude a little negative and not particularly inclusive to anyone aside from ‚Äúelite‚Äù programmers. Use what works for your team and you should absolutely try TDD and persevere with it until you‚Äôve had a good try.\n\nWe should be pulling our fellow engineers up, not sneering at them because they use tools and practises that we don‚Äôt agree with or discouraging them because of our own internal biases. That‚Äôs the whole point of teams, to work together and to experiment.",
