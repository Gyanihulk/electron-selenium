      "content": "My Team is Not My Family\n\nI recently read about how Netflix conducted an internal survey and let go of employees who considered their colleagues ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù And‚Äîdeep down‚ÄîI agreed with this decision. I‚Äôd actually be concerned if my team felt like family to me.\n\nSounds harsh, right? But let‚Äôs break it down.\n\nI deeply value every member at my workplace. We joke around in internal chats and personal messages, check in on each other, have a blast at corporate events, and communicate openly. In every project I‚Äôve led, I‚Äôve always prioritized creating a great atmosphere, and it remains one of my main focuses Ô∏è\n\nThat being said, I don‚Äôt see my partners and employees as family. Instead, we‚Äôre more like a sports team striving for a common goal‚Äîlike an Olympic squad.\nLet me explain from a psychological perspective. Relationships are often built around fulfilling certain needs.\nWhat kind of needs might someone who looks for ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in their team be trying to fulfill?\n‚ñ´Ô∏è unconditional love and acceptance\n‚ñ´Ô∏è support\n‚ñ´Ô∏è safety\n‚ñ´Ô∏è stability and predictability (family is forever)\nLet‚Äôs ignore the obvious contradiction here‚Äîno one in a family owes anyone anything, yet a CEO is expected to pay salaries . Instead, let‚Äôs think‚Äîcan I truly meet those needs?\n\nNo, because I‚Äôm building my brand.\nFor comparison, my needs as an entrepreneur and leader are entirely different‚Äînot family-oriented:\n high net profit\n satisfied clients\n efficient use of resources\nTo achieve this, I need results and the unique strengths of each team member. I have to set goals and tasks, require KPI fulfillment, enforce deadlines and agreements.\nThis brings us to another issue with seeing a team as family‚Äîthe development of strong secondary emotional ties.\nIf person isn‚Äôt performing well, and I‚Äôm emotionally attached to them, it will be harder for me to explain what's wrong. But‚Ä¶ this paradise wouldn‚Äôt last long anyway, because inefficient work leads to financial losses, and the business would eventually collapse.\n\nSo, what‚Äôs my approach?\nI advocate for a partnership-based and respectful attitude to team.\nWhat are your thoughts and feelings about this attitude toward a team?\n\n(P.S. Bruno is helping me to manage my work  )",

But here‚Äôs how you can fix it \n\nThe stats are brutal\n\n361 billion emails were sent in 2024 and a huge chunk of them went straight to spam\n\nReps are burning through their domains, writing novels no one reads and wondering why open rates are dead in the water\n\nI get it. Email deliverability feels overwhelming. DNS records, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, IP rotation... It‚Äôs a lot. And for most teams it‚Äôs a total blind spot\n\nThats wherecomes in\n\nIts email infrastructure built for cold outreach\n\nHeres why I set it up for my team and clients\n\n Separate domains without the headache. Maildoso lets you create lookalike domains to protect your main one. No more risking your entire company‚Äôs reputation because your reps are blasting emails from a single domain\n\n Automated technical setup. SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and MX records are automatically configured so you don‚Äôt need to be an IT expert to get started\n\n Mailbox rotation. Maildoso rotates between trusted IP addresses ensuring emails are sent from ones with the best reputation to maximize deliverability\n\n Streamlined scaling. Add 5‚Äì10 mailboxes per rep in minutes. Whether you‚Äôre a team of 5 or 50 Maildoso makes scaling cold email simple and manageable\n\nIf you‚Äôre sending cold emails at scale you need to be intentional about your setup\n\nStop letting bad infrastructure kill your deliverability\n\nIn 2025 its all about smarter email‚Äînot more email\n\nCheck out Maildoso and see how easy it is to fix your foundation\n\nP.S.

That seems odd to me; shouldn't you hire more?\n\nEngineers should be able to generate a multiple of their salary in ARR; if they are 30% more effective, they can generate 30% more revenue, making it even easier to justify hiring more engineers.\n\nIf this isn't the case, problems are likely brewing.\n\nOf course, adding new features isn't the only way to generate revenue. However, sales and marketing can only effectively sell the product you actually have built.",

Of course it's entirely short term as eventually the tech debt piles up and they already have a mountain of it to start!\n\nIn the case of a services based company you can charge more per hour given more output, charge per outcome and deliver more outcomes, or have more junior people ramp faster which of course means less time from seniors and higher billable rates. That being said, the services market in most segments is over saturated so you're right that they need to offer more or expand.",
