      "content": "On Thursday, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) strongly opposed the leading restaurant aggregators Zomato and Swiggy entering private-label food delivery through their quick-commerce platforms.\n\nThe NRAI charged Zomato and Swiggy with leveraging their dominant market positions and access to restaurant data to introduce private-label food products directly or through subsidiaries like Blinkit Bistro and Swiggy Cafe/SNACC.\n\n“Zomato and Swiggy, originally established as marketplace platforms, are now leveraging their dominant positions and access to restaurant data to venture into private-label food delivery either directly or via their subsidiary,” the NRAI disclosed, adding that it raises legal concerns under the Copyright Act and associated laws.\n\n“This strategy not only cannibalises the business of restaurants that rely on these platforms but also raises serious concerns under the Copyright Act and related laws,” the association added.\n\nNRAI President and Wow Momo! CEO Sagar Daryani said disapprovingly, “We were always given verbal assurances by the aggregators that they would never resort to private labelling. This is a breach of trust.”\n\nMoreover, he pointed out the issue of consumer masking, stressing that restaurants do not have access to customer data collected by the aggregators.\n\nThe NRAI, representing over five lakh restaurants in India, stated that this move breaches marketplace neutrality and impairs fair competition, creating a significant threat to the survival of restaurants nationwide.\n\nThe industry body further noted that Zomato and Swiggy exploited data derived from restaurant partners while launching competing products, creating a conflict of interest.\n\nDaryani affirmed that the NRAI is “absolutely not okay” with this development, declaring the industry body would seek legal remedies while approaching regulatory authorities.\n\nWith the restaurant industry valued at Rs 5.69 lakh crore, the NRAI has urged restaurants, customers and regulators to work together and maintain ethical practices in the competitive food delivery space.",

This decision highlights a disturbing trend where profits are prioritized over people. Employees are the backbone of any organization, and treating them as expendable undermines their immense contribution to a company’s success. Did the management consider the families who depend on these employees? In a country like India, where social security is minimal, such actions leave people vulnerable, with no safety net to fall back on. The government must step in immediately to address this issue and hold companies accountable for the well-being of their workforce. Organizations must realize that their true strength lies in their employees, not just in profits. It's time to put people first.",
