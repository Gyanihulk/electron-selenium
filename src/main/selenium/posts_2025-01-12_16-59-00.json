      "content": "At the outset, let me wish you and your loved ones a Happy and Prosperous 2025. May all your dreams come true.\n\nWanted to share my thoughts on HR landscape for 2025. The top 5 trends that I see are:\n1. Integration AI in HR: AI has already entered workplace, but the penetration has not been substantial with the use largely focused on query handling, summarization and analysis of data points including basic level-1 of prediction. Going forward, AI in HR will be used for taking “action” based on analysis, comparison of options and choosing the right options given the boundary objectives. This will see a re-configuration of roles and capabilities. For example, right now AI usage is about telling me number of leaves that I have, after going through my leave record. Next usage will be agent driven by AI applying for leave after looking at data of “leaves” of other co-workers so as to ensure work continuity.\n2. Health – physical and mental: We are already witnessing increase in ailments. We will see increase in physical and mental ailments including fatigue, obesity, lifestyle diseases, anxiety and sleep related disorders. Organizations need to keep employee health as the core focus of their people strategy and then actively work towards managing the controllable.\n\n3. K shaped Compensation: K shaped compensation refers to growing disparity in pay and benefits within organizations depending on certain skills which are experiencing significant growth in compensation while others are stagnating. This is driven by the demand -supply gap for certain skills in the market. Organizations need to make sure that critical talent are retained and compensation are in sync with the market.\n\n4. Talent Networks: We will see increasing trend of ‘non employees’ working closely with employees to create value. Gig employees is one of the manifestation of ‘non employees’ there could be others like consumers, independent work groups, integrated back end and so on. Organizations need to explore how such talent networks can be leveraged for value creation.\n5. Buddy Leader: We have seen lot of examples of Superstar Leader. There is also lot of talk of ‘Servant leaders’. But the future belongs to leaders who can be ‘Buddy leaders’ – those who don’t believe in power distance and operate as buddies, but at the same time able to influence the course of action. What's the leadership style in your organization ? Try to encourage Buddy Leadership.\n\nThese are the 5 trends that I see in HR in 2025. Happy to expand and explain (on direct basis).\nHappy New Year!",
