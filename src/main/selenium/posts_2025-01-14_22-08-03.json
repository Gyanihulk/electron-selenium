      "content": "In my years building teams, I've noticed that exceptional performers in their first 90 days share something beyond just drive or skills - they aren't paralyzed by perfectionism. Here's what I've noticed to be a common characteristic in high-performing people when they are stepping into a new role:\n\n• Take ownership of specific problems\n• Move fast, iterate quickly\n• Learn through action, not preparation\n• Bring solutions, not just problems\n• Show results within the first few weeks\n\nThe secret? It's about being proactive. It's not about being perfect.\n\nTop performers don't wait until they understand everything. They pick a challenge, own it, and move fast while staying adaptable.\n\nRemember: In startups, it's better to move fast and course-correct than to wait for perfect conditions. The velocity of execution and learning matters more than anything else.",

          "commentText": "In pure research, it is just the opposite - move deep even if it seems quite slow. But that is bound to be due to often longer struggle phase of 2-3 years even in a Phd program and as Assistant professor and seemingly no time boundary for associate and full professors and independent researchers. Startups are an optimum combination of depth and speed - neither can be bad if the startup has to succeed. That's why all successful startups earn their success even though some failed startups might have failed purely due to luck factors also.",
