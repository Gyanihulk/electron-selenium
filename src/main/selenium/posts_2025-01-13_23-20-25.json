Best of luck with your outreach!”\n\nGot hit with an objection handle: “Just to confirm - closing more deals faster isn’t a priority?”\n\nI get the approach: The idea is to “trap” the prospect into a question they can’t say no to.\n\n“What sales leader wouldn’t want more deals, faster?”\n\nHere’s the problem: I’m not objecting to the proposed outcome. Closing more deals faster is ALWAYS a priority for me.\n\nI’m just already working on my top priorities to help my teams close more deals faster. We’ve identified tools supporting those priorities and are in execution mode.\n\nMy objection wasn’t to the outcome. It was the approach this solution takes to drive that outcome. The problems they solve to drive that outcome are not painful for me.\n\nWhen you get a no, don’t fall back to the high-level outcome:\n\n- “Oh, you don’t want to save money on your HR solutions?”\n\n- “Really, you don’t want to reduce the risk of getting hacked?”\n\n- “Huh, you don’t want your developers to be happy and productive?”\n\nOf course your buyers want those outcomes. If they are objecting, they likely either:\n\n- Don’t believe you can drive that outcome\n\n- Believe a different approach will work better\n\nFind out which of those your objection falls under and address that for better success.\n\nHere’s what that follow-up might look like:\n\n“Makes perfect sense you’ve already got a handle on this. Usually this means you’ve got a similar solution in place and I didn’t do a good job sharing how we are different, or you are attacking this priority through a completely different approach.\n\nCan I ask where you fall?”\n\nNext time you hear “this isn’t a priority” to something that you know should be a priority, give this a shot!",

Solid team?\n\nYes to all of those.\n\nBut … I was also extremely purposeful with my performance, and it paid off (literally).\n\nThese were the 5 high-leverage moves I made in my first year that set the foundation for earning life-changing wealth in my 4 year tenure there:\n\n1. Thought like a CEO\n\n2. Was disciplined with my “launch strategy”\n\n3. Made my account list mean something to me\n\n4. Didn’t wait to have real business conversations\n\n5. Thought more like a creative content creator\n\nI break down all 5 of these in a free guide:\n\nIt’s a new year.\n\nPerhaps it’s time for a new way to operate?\n\n",
