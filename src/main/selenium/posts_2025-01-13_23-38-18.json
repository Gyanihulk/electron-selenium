What is happening out there?!”\n\nI’ll tell you what is happening: you have NO IDEA what you’re doing! You’re lost in the forest walking around in circles! Just because you thought it was “easy” to find a job in 2017…you *think* you know how to do it now. YOU DO NOT!!\n\nThe two reasons *most likely* responsible for the above:\n\n1) Your resume sucks!\n2) You’re unable to assess your skills and you’re applying to jobs you’re no where near qualified for.\n\nOne of the most painful things I hear when I speak to people about their resume: “Ugh….I applied to all those jobs with my sh*tty resume…sigh…do you think I should go back and re-apply?” Answer: I don’t know. Sure, maybe if the role is still posted.\n\nPlease, stop applying to roles (and wasting your shot) until you have your resume audited by a real Recruiter! Not your mom who once worked in HR…not your hiring manager buddy…not some random person on LI who now calls themselves a career coach ()\n\nYour resume has ONE goal: to secure a call!",

It's easy to get caught up in the negativity, wishing we had done things differently. But what if we could shift our camera & perspective\n\nWithin our struggles lies a hidden magic. Our uncertainty, our lostness, and even our discomfort are opportunities for growth and transformation. They are the seeds of change, pushing us to evolve into the best versions of ourselves.\n\nThink about a time when you faced a challenging situation or pushed into unexpected crisis (where u didn't have any role to play). Maybe you felt overwhelmed, unsure of the next step. In retrospect, you likely realize that experience taught you valuable lessons, strengthened your resilience, and led you to a better place.\n\nIt's about recognizing that every step, every stumble, every moment of doubt is part of a larger journey. It's about trusting that the universe has a plan, and that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope, a chance to learn and grow.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself feeling lost or discouraged, remember & hold onto the belief that within your struggles lies the potential for something extraordinary. It's just the bend nd not the end...One day, you will look back on this time and see the magic that unfolded, the person you became because of it.",

      "content": "CAREER COACHING & PRICING: BUYER BEWARE!\n\nYou charge how much?!\n\n$3999 a month is obscene.\n\nIf you can't afford to pay in cash, the company offers the opportunity to FINANCE their services at 0%.\n\nHow generous.\n\nAs if losing your job isn't traumatic enough, you now need to fend off the wolves in sheep's clothing who are preying on the fears and desperation of jobseekers.\n\nPerhaps these predatory fees would be justified if Andrew Carnegie or JP Morgan was your personal coach, but since they aren't, it feels more like shakedown from the Gambino Crime Family.\n\nThe reality is that the CEO has a few years of recruiting experience and staffs his company with college interns whose only previous professional experience was bartending at the local wing joint.\n\nSo, definitely worth the price of a Caribbean vacation.\n\nEnough is enough. There are a million and two free resources to help jobseekers with CV templates, cover letters, LinkedIn optimization and mock interview questions which don't require require selling a kidney or draining your bank account.\n\nSo, ask yourself if these coaches are really selling anything more than hope to drowning jobseekers who are looking for a professional life raft?\n\nIf all the the advice given (and sold) is so effective, why are there millions of people still looking for work?\n\nAre they working for your best interests or their own?\n\nHint: you can have a perfectly written CV, a cover letter written by Shakespeare himself, a PhD and a Nobel Peace Price and still not get called to interview or receive an offer when there are simply more candidates than available jobs.\n\nFact.\n\nBuyer beware, indeed.\n\nBELIEVE IN YOURSELF AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IN YOU!",
