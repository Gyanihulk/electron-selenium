      "content": "This is in response to *Larsen & Toubro* Chairman S.N. *Subrahmanyan‚Äôs *advice to employees* to *work 90 hours a week*‚Äîamounting to 18 hours a day for a 5-day workweek or 16.5 hours a day for a 6-day workweek‚Äîand his statement about ‚Äú*not staring at your wife*.‚Äù\nQuestions to L&T Chairman and Management:\n1.     Does Labour Law apply to you?\nIndian labor laws explicitly prohibit such long working hours. How do you justify this statement within the legal framework?\n2.     Do you care about employee well-being and mental health?\nExtended work hours have proven detrimental to physical and mental health. Does L&T prioritize profits over the health of its employees?\n3.     Does L&T respect work-life balance?\nAdvising employees to ignore their spouses and families undermines the very essence of a balanced life. Is this the culture you wish to foster?\n\nSome Stark Contrasts: The Chairman earned ‚Çπ51 crore in FY24, which is 534.57 times the median salary of peers. Is it fair to demand such grueling commitments from employees while enjoying an astronomical pay disparity?\n\nSuggesting employees not engage with their spouses reflects insensitivity, potentially leading to strained relationships, higher divorce rates, and broken families.\n\nQuestions for Aspiring Employees:\nWhy should any sensible, qualified individual choose to work at *L&T* under such oppressive expectations?\n\nEven history‚Äôs harshest regimes, like Hitler‚Äôs, didn‚Äôt impose such unrealistic commitments.\nAre employees to be treated as slaves in modern India?\n\nMessage to Stakeholders:\nIt‚Äôs time to re-evaluate relationships with Larsen & Toubro‚Äîwhether as employees, investors, or suppliers.\nA culture that prioritizes exploitation over humanity deserves neither talent nor support.\nGovt of India being single largest shareholder thru PSUs (like LIC, Insurance Companies etc.) should ask Subrahmanyan to quit L & T or sack him to show the Capitalists treating Employees as SLAVES way out.",

Statements like \"Microsoft will invest\" refer to future intentions, not present actions. As of now, Microsoft has announced plans to invest $3 billion over the next two years to enhance its cloud and AI infrastructure in India.\n\nWhile this commitment is promising, it's crucial to focus on the tangible benefits that existing cloud AI capabilities offer today. Microsoft's current AI infrastructure is already being utilized to enhance public services, improve healthcare delivery, and support educational initiatives.\n\nBlindly applauding announcements of future investments without understanding their current impact reflects a desire for immediate gratification, akin to expecting instant deliveries. Instead, let's engage thoughtfully with the present capabilities and consider how they can be leveraged for societal benefit. This approach fosters a more informed and proactive community, ready to utilize technology effectively rather than passively awaiting future developments.\n\nIn summary, while future investments are encouraging, it's the present applications of cloud AI that hold immediate potential for societal welfare. Let's focus on that",

Many teams use private repositories like Bitbucket or internal tools. Everything is mostly private. If they could show those commits, their graph would be green every day.\n\n2. Students and junior developers often use GitHub to showcase their projects, challenges, or learning milestones.\n\nThat‚Äôs great, but it doesn‚Äôt automatically mean they‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than someone with a gray graph who‚Äôs been solving real-world problems for years.\n\n3. git commits can be backdated or faked. A few commands and your GitHub can look like you‚Äôve been coding non-stop for years. Does that show skill? No.\n\n4.A graph won‚Äôt tell me how you debug tough issues, work with a team, or handle edge cases in production.\n\nWhat actually matters to me?\n\n- Your problem-solving skills. Can you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code?\n- Your mindset. Are you curious and eager to learn?\n- Your collaboration. Can you work with others to build great software?\n- Your impact. Do you understand the \"why\" behind what you're building?\n\nGreen graphs are cool to look at, but they‚Äôre not the full story.\n\nAnd developers, if your GitHub isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgreen enough,‚Äù don‚Äôt let that hold you back.\n\nFocus on building great things, public or private.\n\nWhat do you think? Do green graphs matter in hiring? Let me know below!",

      "content": "üîß Understanding Different Types of Shear Stirrups in RCC Structures\n\nWhen it comes to reinforced concrete design, shear stirrups play a crucial role in resisting shear forces and preventing failure in beams and columns.\n\nThe type of stirrup arrangement you choose depends on the structural requirements. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ One-Legged Stirrup:\nSimplest form, typically used for light reinforcement requirements.\n\nCommonly seen in isolated sections or specific structural elements.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Two-Legged Stirrup:\nA widely used configuration.\nProvides enhanced shear resistance for beams and columns.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Three-Legged Stirrup:\nIdeal for sections with higher shear force demands.\nAdds additional shear capacity by increasing the number of shear-resisting bars.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Four-Legged Stirrup:\nMaximum reinforcement provided for shear forces.\nUsed in heavy-loaded structures where high shear strength is critical.\n\nWhy does this matter?\nThe choice of stirrup arrangement directly impacts the structural integrity and load-bearing capacity of the element.\n\nUnderstanding this ensures safer designs and efficient material usage.\n\n‚ú® Share your thoughts: Which stirrup arrangement do you commonly use, and in what scenarios?",

No matter the industry, whether you're in tech, finance, retail, or any other field, empathy can truly make a difference. It‚Äôs not something optional, it‚Äôs something essential.\n\n‚û°Why? Because at the end of the day, businesses are made up of people. And when we take the time to understand each other, everything works better. Empathy is about stepping into someone else‚Äôs shoes, understanding their challenges, and showing that you care. It‚Äôs about listening, not just hearing. It‚Äôs about offering support, not just instructions.\n\n‚û°In a workplace where empathy is part of the culture, you‚Äôll see stronger collaboration, better communication, and a more motivated team. People feel valued when they know their concerns are understood. When managers lead with empathy, they build trust, and trust is the foundation of any strong team.\n\n‚û°But empathy isn‚Äôt just for leaders‚Äîit‚Äôs for everyone. Colleagues who show empathy towards each other create a positive work environment. When someone‚Äôs having a tough day, a little understanding can go a long way. It reduces stress, boosts morale, and helps everyone feel like they‚Äôre part of something bigger.\n\n‚û°Empathy also impacts decision-making. When we consider how our actions affect others, we make choices that benefit the whole team, not just ourselves. This leads to better outcomes for the business and a more supportive atmosphere for everyone.\n\n‚û°In industries that are fast-paced and high-pressure, empathy might seem like a luxury. But the truth is, it‚Äôs a necessity. It doesn‚Äôt take much time to show empathy, and the return on that investment is huge‚Äîbetter relationships, stronger teams, and a healthier work environment.\n‚û°\nSo let‚Äôs stop treating empathy like a \"nice-to-have\" Because when we lead with empathy, we make the workplace better for everyone. And that‚Äôs something every industry needs. I always remember the great advise I've got from my mentor \"Kindness is free, meanness cost a fortune!",

Understanding that success is not always a straight line is essential for maintaining resilience, adapting to challenges, and embracing the valuable lessons hidden in the curves of the road.\n\n1) Embracing Failure as a Stepping Stone:\n\nSuccess is seldom without setbacks. Failures and mistakes are not roadblocks but rather stepping stones on the journey to success. Each misstep provides an opportunity to learn, grow, and refine one's approach.\n\n2) Learning Through Adversity:\n\nThe road to success is often paved with adversity. Challenges, obstacles, and unexpected events are inevitable. It's in facing these adversities that individuals develop valuable skills, hone their problem-solving abilities, and build the mental fortitude necessary for long-term success.\n\n3) Iterative Progress:\n\nSuccess is rarely achieved in a single giant leap. Instead, it often involves incremental progress through continuous improvement. Each step forward, regardless of its size, contributes to the overall journey.\n\n4) Navigating Uncertainty:\n\nSuccessful individuals are those who can navigate this uncertainty with a combination of strategic planning, adaptability, and a willingness to pivot when necessary\n\n5) Reassessing Goals and Priorities:\n\nAs one progresses on the path to success, goals and priorities may evolve. What seemed like the pinnacle of success at the outset might shift as personal and professional landscapes change.\n\n6) Building a Support System:\n\nWhether it's mentors, peers, or a network of like-minded individuals, having a support system provides encouragement during challenging times and offers diverse perspectives that can prove invaluable on the journey.\n\nFollow",
