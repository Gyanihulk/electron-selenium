      "content": "Urban infill sites offer great opportunities to build more homes sustainably. For example, we've helped our client transform this site from two dwellings into 10 homes.\n\nWe are big fans of urban infill housing developments and here are 8 reasons why:\n\n1️⃣ Efficient Use of Resources:\n\nInfill development maximises existing infrastructure, including roads, utilities, and services; it reduces the need for new construction and minimises costs.\n\n2️⃣ Efficient Use of Land:\n\nBy focusing on infill, cities can make more efficient use of previously developed (brownfield) land.\n\n3️⃣ Reduced Urban Sprawl:\n\nBy focusing on infill, cities can contain their outward growth to preserve surrounding greenfields and prevent encroachment into natural habitats and agricultural land.\n\n4️⃣ Enhanced Public Transport Accessibility:\n\nInfill sites are typically located near existing public transport networks, promoting the use of mass transit and reducing reliance on cars, which lowers greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n5️⃣ Revitalisation of Underutilised Areas:\n\nDeveloping infill sites can rejuvenate neglected or declining neighbourhoods, boost local economies, and improve residents' quality of life.\n\n6️⃣ Walkability & Community:\n\nHigher-density developments encourage walkable neighbourhoods, foster community interactions, and reduce dependence on automobiles, which can enhance social cohesion.\n\n7️⃣ Environmental Benefits:\n\nBy preserving green spaces and reducing the need for infrastructure expansion, infill development contributes to lower energy consumption, reduced habitat destruction, and supporting biodiversity.\n\n8️⃣ Economic Strengthening:\n\nInfill development can lead to increased property values and tax revenues, providing funds for public services and community enhancements that ultimately benefit the local economy.\n\nThese reasons underscore the importance of prioritising urban infill as a strategy for delivering more affordable homes, creating stronger communities, promoting sustainable urban development, and preserving green spaces.\n\nThe development shown is the Saplings, a residential development by our client PIC Homes comprising 10 large-family homes in Timperley, Trafford.",

      "content": "Indians are making lakhs out of Coldplay tickets!\n\n\nRemember when Coldplay tickets were released in India?\n\nThey sold out in seconds.\nPeople were literally in queues to buy them.\n\nAnd now I see that they are back.\n\nAlmost every group that I am in, I see people re-selling these tickets.\n\nBut there's a catch.\n\nIf they bought it for a few thousands, they are selling it for lakhs now.\n\nAnd there are buyers at these prices too.\n\nSurprisingly, there's a huge white space for ticket re-selling in India.\n\nEven globally, the secondary ticket market is estimated to be worth $1.74 billion in 2024, and is expected to grow to a massive $3.59 billion by 2032.\n\nWhile there are a few online platforms that cater to this purpose, I can't recall a dominant player in this area due to the lack of trust and possibility of scams.\n\nHaving said that, did you buy the Coldplay tickets?\n\nAnd if you did, maybe comment below and find someone who's happy to buy it at a resale!",

      "content": "Solve an industry problem , Build 1 Million Revenue . You will have a story to tell rest of your life.\n\nIn the realm of innovation, the journey from idea to reality is a thrill like no other. If you've ever envisioned making a significant impact and charting your course to success, now is the time to heed the call and embark on your entrepreneurial adventure.\n\nWhy Initiate Now?\n\nThe landscape is ripe with challenges, presenting opportunities to revolutionize entire sectors by addressing inefficiencies and gaps. With the advent of digital tools, global connectivity, and remote collaboration, the path to launching a startup has never been more accessible.\n\nYour breakthrough concept doesn't have to be intricate—it simply needs to address a genuine problem.\n\nThe Blueprint for Crafting Your $1 Million Revenue Narrative\n\n1. Recognize the Challenge\nSuccessful startups alleviate pain points. Pay heed to frustrations within your industry, workplace dynamics, or discussions with peers. Often, brilliant ideas are right before our eyes.\n\nAsk yourself:\n- What obstacles do I encounter in my role or industry?\n- Is there a way to streamline this process for others?\n\n2. Think Small, Dream Large\n\nProgress doesn't demand hefty funding. Begin with a minimum viable product (MVP) that tackles the core issue. Validate your solution with real users, allowing their feedback to steer your evolution.\n\n3. Cultivate Relationships, Not Just Products\n\nEarly adopters and partners aren't mere clients—they're your advocates. Foster connections, grasp their needs profoundly, and develop a product experience that fosters trust and loyalty.\n\n4. Embrace Resilience and Adversity\n\nEvery entrepreneur encounters obstacles—financial constraints, product refinements, self-doubt. These moments don't signify failure; they sculpt your progress. Successful founders persevere where others falter.\n\nA Story to Tell for the Rest of Your Life\nImagine the pride of looking back and knowing that you created something from scratch—a company that reached $1 million in revenue, transformed lives, and added lasting value. Your journey will be one of growth, impact, and resilience—one that becomes a story worth telling for the rest of your life.\n\nYour Startup Journey Begins Now\n\nTake that first step, however small. You don’t need all the answers—just the courage to start.",

      "content": "First AE hired. Zero pipeline. No playbook. Just me staring at an empty CRM wondering if I'd made a huge mistake.\n\nHere's my honest story of those first 45 days:\n\n• Week 1-2: Studied the product, started running campaigns & doing mock demos.\n\n• Week 3-4: Started taking sales calls some better than others & expanded to other outreach channels.\n\n• Week 5-6: Felt pretty alone at times but started seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Other AEs had teammates, but I was testing everything by myself.\n\n• Week 7+ (Present): Averaging a little over 6 demos per day & hitting the ground running prospecting every morning\n\nWhat I learned:\n1. Write down everything - my mistakes will help myself & others avoid them\n2. Accept the chaos - good systems start messy\n3. Make friends first, sell second - early customers help shape everything.\n\nBeing first is a challenge for sure but I'm having fun with it.\n\nFounding AEs: What was your biggest \"I wish someone told me this\" moment?\n\nPS- Happy Friday! Cheers!",
