With SEBI’s approval, Ather is set to launch its IPO, aiming to raise ₹3,100 crore through fresh shares and an offer-for-sale of 2.2 crore shares.\n\nThe company is targeting a valuation of $2.5 billion, showing its strong belief in shaping the future of electric mobility.\n\nThe funds from the IPO will be used to build a new factory in Maharashtra, invest in R&D, and expand marketing efforts. This step is not just about raising money—it’s about driving innovation and making EVs more accessible for everyone.\n\nBacked by investors like Tiger Global, NIIF, and Binny Bansal, Ather has shown great determination despite challenges, including a net loss of ₹1,059.7 crore in FY24.\n\nTheir focus on pushing boundaries and creating a sustainable future makes this IPO a milestone for the EV industry.",
