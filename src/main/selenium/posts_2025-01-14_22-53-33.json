Each one carrying a piece of her boundless love.\n\n2) The Eternal Explorer: At 80+, she had the curiosity of a 21-year-old, traveling from Singapore to Dubai, and finally to Ram Mandir - living life with more enthusiasm than people a quarter her age.\n\n3) The Graceful Goodbye: Seven days ago, she left us exactly how she lived - peacefully, having fulfilled all her wishes, and without suffering. A perfect ending to a life lived perfectly.\n\nHere's to you, Dadi - forever young, forever loved ️",

      "content": " 12 Moments of Gratitude: Reflecting on an Incredible Year (3 of 12)\n\n Moment 3/12: The Power of Relationships\n\nI’m beyond grateful for the incredible relationships I’ve built over the years in the restaurant and franchising industry.\n\nThese connections have not only shaped my journey but also led to some of the most meaningful moments—like one unforgettable dinner at the Restaurant Finance & Development Conference in Las Vegas last November. ()\n\nIt started with two separate conversations. Based on the projects I’m working on, my good friendtold me I needed to meet someone named. Just 15 minutes later, I ran into another good friendand as we were catching up, he said the exact same thing: “You need to meet Louis.” And then, almost like it was meant to be, I got a text from Louis himself.\n\nLouis, his partner Steve, and I met up briefly before dinner to run through introductions and share our backgrounds. In just a short time, we created a fast connection—one of those rare bonds where everything clicks, and you feel like you’ve known each other much longer.\n\nThat evening, I joined,,,, and Jim Ellis for dinner.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I found myself surrounded by like-minded people I’d never met before but who felt instantly familiar. We shared stories, wisdom, and so many mutual connections that the night was filled with laughter, mentorship, and new perspectives.\n\nWhat made it even more special was hearing Louis share his journey of founding, growing, and successfully exiting his company,.\n\nHis story, along with the generous advice and encouragement from everyone at the table, left me inspired, motivated, and deeply appreciative.\n\nI had an important event that evening, one I would normally prioritize, but something told me to take this opportunity instead. I’m so glad I followed my instincts.\n\nThis dinner wasn’t just a meeting—it was a powerful reminder of the importance of relationships.\n\nWhether it’s reconnecting with familiar faces or meeting someone entirely new, the connections we make can lead to opportunities, inspiration, and growth in ways we can’t always anticipate.\n\nIt’s easy to stick with what’s familiar at conferences, but sometimes the greatest value comes from following your instincts and leaning into new relationships.\n\nYou never know when a simple introduction might spark new ideas, inspire fresh perspectives, or open the door to something greater.\n\nHere’s to the people who inspire us, the relationships that shape us, and the opportunities to grow through shared wisdom and purpose.",

      "content": "7 ways to show you’re an expert \n\n(without saying you’re an expert):\n\nThe best \"expert\" I met fixes cars in a tiny garage in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nHe never calls himself an expert. But I noticed something about how he works with customers:\n\nWhen someone brings their Mercedes with a weird sound, he listens. Then he tells them about three other cars that made the same noise last month.\n\nHe explains what caused it, what didn't work, and what fixed it.\n\nYou see, true experts don't tell. They show.\n\nHere are 7 signs someone knows their stuff (beyond certificates or followers):\n\n1. They can answer questions at multiple depths\n\nA kid asks how planes fly? They talk about birds. A pilot asks? They break down wing design and air pressure. They match their answer to who asks.\n\n2. They adapt their vocabulary\n\nA chef talks about \"reduction\" with other chefs. But with home cooks? \"We're just boiling this sauce until it gets thicker.\" Same concept, different words.\n\n3. They stay calm explaining basics\n\nPicture a math teacher. The good ones never mock students for counting on fingers. They remember when they did it too.\n\n4. They admit their failures\n\n\"Want to see my first painting? It's terrible.\" Art teachers who show their early work help students more than those who only display masterpieces.\n\n5. They point to others' work\n\nAsk a basketball coach about shooting form? They'll say \"Watch how Steph Curry does it.\" Great teachers share their heroes.\n\n6. They spot patterns\n\nA doctor hears your symptoms and remembers similar cases. Not because they're smart - because they've seen it before. Experience beats memorization.\n\n7. They say \"I don't know\"\n\nThe best teachers admit when they're stumped. They turn \"I don't know\" into \"Let's find out together.\"\n\nPractical takeaway for creatives:\n\nDon't call yourself an expert. Let your work prove you are one.\n\n—\n\nFor a limited time, get my curation workshop for only $19.\n\nLink in bio.",
