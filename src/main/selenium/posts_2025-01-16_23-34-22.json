Would you agree?\nModel Architecture\nLarge language models, such as GPT, have a fixed context window limiting how much text they can process at once. Current models support up to 100,000 tokens (roughly 75,000 words or fewer).\nThis limitation stems from the Transformer architecture, which requires maintaining attention across all tokens. As the token count increases, the computational load grows exponentially.\nPerformance and Practicality\nProcessing larger texts in a single pass requires significantly more memory and computational power, leading to slower response times and higher costs.\nMany documents can be effectively analyzed by breaking them into smaller sections for summary and analysis, which reduces the need for extensive context windows.\nCost and Efficiency\nExpanding context windows demands additional resources, increasing operational costs for providers and users alike.",
