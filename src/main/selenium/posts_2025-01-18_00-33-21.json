      "content": "‚ÄòYour main marketing channel is founder brand.‚Äô he smirked. We had built a $5M ARR business with nothing but journey-led marketing.\n\nThey had 20 outbound SDRs and a traditional sales playbook.\n\nI had a founder newsletter (and, at the time a blog) and a simple rule about trust.\n\nGuess which company had shorter sales cycles?\n\nThe conversation happened a few years back and I still remember it like yesterday. It went like this:\n\nThem: \"What's your outbound strategy?\"\n\nMe: \"We don't have one. We're inbound-led.\"\n\nThem: \"That's impossible. How do you predict revenue?\"\n\nI had to laugh. Because here's what I didn't tell them:\n\nIt's amazing how sales velocity emerges when you're building genuine relationships and trust over time directly w/ your ICP (and respond to inbound signals instead of chasing with cold outreach).\n\nSome real numbers from our \"unscalable\" approach vs traditional SDR math:\n\n- 70% faster sales cycles\n- 3x pipeline per rep\n- 140K engaged email list subscribers\n- Team of 5 (yes, total)\n\nBut these metrics barely came up. Instead, I got the usual:\n\n\"You need more SDRs\"\n\"Content doesn't scale\"\n\"What about predictable revenue?\"\n\nHere's what I've learned after 12 years of journey-led growth:\n\nThe best sales decisions come from having skin in the game.\n\nWhen it's your reputation on the line, you develop an instinct for value that no sales script can replicate.\n\nI'm proud that every deal we've closed started from trust built organically, not cold calls. Every relationship we've built was because the our content pulled our ICP in, not because we pushed our way to them.\n\nThe irony? By staying journey-led and content-driven, we have more predictable growth than many traditional sales orgs.\n\nNo meetings about activity metrics.\n\nNo pressure to hit call quotas.\n\nJust the simple mandate to build something customers want to engage with.\n\nTo my fellow journey-led founders: Next time someone questions your \"scalability\", remember‚Äîthere's nothing unscalable about building a business that runs on trust.\n\nIt's not about how many calls you make.\n\nIt's about how much value you create for your customers.\n\nAnd sometimes, the best sales strategy is simply building trust over time by providing the value your ICP is actually looking for, not constantly selling people into oblivion.",
