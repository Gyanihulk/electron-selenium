      "content": "Continuing the 2025 post series with post number 6.\n\nTypically, my posts are about marketing or retail. After all, I have been in the retail industry off and on for over 30 years, with marketing as my main focus during that period and I run a firm that brings together companies and athletes to effectively market their products and services.\n\nBut today I am going to post about food safety. I know, right? What does this guy know about food safety? Admittedly much less than I should as a parent. What limited amounts I know mostly comes from being a parent to a child with Celiac's disease, which will affect her entire life, especially if untreated. When she was not treated (because we didn't know) she was in the 10th percentile height and even lower in weight relative to her peers. Today, treated, she is nearly at the 50th percentile in height, still below average in weight but certainly in the healthy weight range for her age.\n\nOne of the things I love about my daughter is how, at 8 years old, she is hyper-involved in her eating choices. Even this morning she insisted I show her the milk carton to prove to her that there was no gluten in milk. I laughed when I showed it to her of course, but stopped laughing later when I searched and found this: \"Plain cow's milk is naturally gluten-free, but flavored milks and other dairy products may contain gluten. It's important to read the label to check for gluten.\" My daughter is on to something.\n\nAnd so yesterday I heard that the FDA was banning red dye #3 from all foods and that by January 2027- that's right, two years from now, it has to be gone. Drug makers, including those making ADD medicine for children, have another year to comply.\n\nThe part that stunned me about this announcement was that the same FDA which oversees the food industry prohibited the cosmetic industry from using red dye #3--not making this part up--30 years ago. No one has been allowed to put this on their face since the 90's, but today children eating up to 100mg of synthetic food dyes A DAY is not unheard of.\n\nMany of the food companies have argued the risk is very small. But those risks are underplayed because the statement has always been that the doses would have to be massive, sustained over years and present in nearly all foods to put someone at risk.\n\nBut synthetic food dyes are in nearly every children's cereal, candy, and medicine. And the FDA has known that at least one of them was proven to cause cancer in laboratory mice, and has known this since 1990. And has failed to act. Glad they finally chose to do so.\n\nGoing to start being even more careful about what we buy for the kids.",

      "content": "It‚Äôs around 60 days since joining Nooks, and while I‚Äôm still drinking from the fire hose, I'm so happy to share that several experiences have already reaffirmed that joining Nooks was a fantastic decision...\n\n-Ran one of our first team meetings last week, and at the end of the call, a rep spoke up to say ‚Äúcan we all just hang on for a little longer to catch up? It feels so nice to have a true team.‚Äù Cue everyone popcorning an answer to their favorite celebratory cocktail/mocktail \n\n-We had a mix up on an account (we all know duplicate records happen) and instead of having to diffuse a situation between two reps on the same team over an active opportunity, the AEs had already slacked each other, handled the situation assuming positive intent, and traded accounts.\n\n\n-During a leadership meeting, a gap in our current process came to light. I received an invite to brainstorm a solution with supporting documentation within a day turnaround. The pace here of problem solving is truly rocketship level!\n\nWhat a dream team we have at @Nooks.I'm feeling really lucky!\n\nPs. Our Enterprise team is hiring, alongside plenty of other roles at Nooks. Would love to connect!",

      "content": "VP of Engineering wrongly put on PIP and terminated after 10 years of employment. Increases severance from $24k to $126k or 423%.\n\nI consulted with a truly impressive and highly intelligent engineering leader named Shaun. He was targeted with a wrongful termination by a new leader who recently joined the company. This after the departing leader recommended Shaun for the role.\n\nShaun was put on a ridiculous and underserved PIP after having received nothing but the highest possible performance reviews during his entire 10-year tenure.\n\nOf course, Shaun beat every measurable metric in the PIP as the PIP was designed to embarrass and demean him so that he would leave, not to improve or retain. Shaun was terminated within a few weeks of beating the PIP based on subjective, immeasurable untruths.\n\nCan you imagine putting this guy on a PIP.  Just disgusting, but a tool used by tools to manage older workers out of the business and to justify their termination if they don‚Äôt leave on their own.\n\nTo make matters worse, if possible, they pressured him to sign the severance by offering only 5 days to do so. Despite being over 40 years old and entitled to 21 days to review the agreement by federal law.\n\nLuckily Shaun came across my LinkedIn profile before his 5 days was up and was relieved to hear that he would get 21 days and that my services existed to help him.\n\nShaun did a great job working with us in putting together a very compelling, shameful and frankly therapeutic document allowing him to state his truthful narrative and show the employer why it was in their best interest to resolve his separation amicably.\n\nThey agreed and we had one of the smoothest negotiations to date.\n\nRound 1: $24k Ô∏è $68k\nRound 2: $68k Ô∏è $102k\nRound 3: $102k Ô∏è $126k\n\nShaun was satisfied and accepted the offer without ever hearing no. He was grateful for our support and amazed at our service, having received an ROI of 9623% on his initial investment with us.\n\nShaun can put the situation behind him and look back on the positive things that he is proud of during his tenure and not how he was discarded.",
