AI’s fault!\"\nBut it wasn’t!!!\nIt was MINE!!\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause when you work with human engineers, you assume experience will fill in gaps, infer context, and connect the dots.\n\nBut with AI if you don’t spell out every detail...\nIt’s like talking to someone who just landed on Earth!\n\nThat’s when the lightbulb moment hit:\n I wasn’t being specific enough!!!\n\nHere’s how AI taught me to be a better Program Manager:\n\n Excel at Defining Requirements\nAI pushed me to revisit functional and non-functional requirements. Even rethinking \"decided\" aspects uncovered better options.\n\n Sharpening User Stories\nWriting for AI has made me better at writing for humans too:\n↳ Goal: State it clearly—specificity is key.\n↳ Context: Provide full background and integration details.\n↳ Requirements: List actions, thresholds, and conditions.\n↳ Extensibility: Plan for future updates.\n↳ Constraints: Highlight edge cases and performance concerns.\n↳ References: Include relevant code or files.\n↳ Outcome: Define success with measurable criteria.\n\n “Explain Me This Code…”\nAI simplifies understanding and adapting unfamiliar code.\n\n Testing and Debugging\nIt’s boosted accuracy, generating tests and finding bugs faster.\nAI didn’t just help me build a game... it made me a better Program Manager.\n\n Take it from me, please!\nIf you want good results programming with AI, be specific... much more than you would be with humans!\n\n Have you used AI for programming?\nDid you experience this too??",

Now, agentic AI and autonomous systems are transforming this dynamic:\n 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 ensure real-time precision.\n 𝗘𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 delivers seamless operations at scale.\n 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 analyze, decide, and act independently.\n\nBut full autonomy isn’t the end goal—it’s a journey. Trust, governance, and human oversight remain essential in every interaction to ensure accountability and transparency.\n\nIn this carousel, I explore:\n The technologies enabling this shift.\n The evolving role of humans in industrial systems.\n The challenges leaders must address to adopt this transformation responsibly.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆—𝗶𝘁’𝘀 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.\nSwipe through to see what’s next, and share your thoughts. Autonomy has a maturity curve and like AGI, we are not there yet.",

Our challenge as leaders is to create a culture where technology empowers, not replaces and accountability remains at the core.",

According to my handy dandy AI buddy,, McKinsey predicts AI could add $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy - and other respected entities are even bolder in their predictions.\n\nI do get worried with all the \"Just add AI\" convos I see, though. The truth is that the first step is easy, so it's table stakes - a digital lift and shift of make-work from humans to tech. No big deal. . . we've been doing that for decades. The doubling of productivity is all the proof point we need.\n\nThe next level of value is at the edges:\n\n1. getting good, timely, complete, contextual data to and from the nodes, and\n2. rethinking processes dynamically so that they support maximum value over time\n\n- all while driving a minimum 250% ROI and minimizing risk/cost\n\n*This* is where the hard work lies - and where the real value is unlocked.",

But there’s also tangible & significant business value being realized today with Industrial AI—and it’s distinct from the more traditional GenAI use cases.\n\nThe transformative leap happens when we focus on ensuring timely, complete, and actionable data flows between nodes, all supported by governance frameworks that drive sustainable ROI. Your point about rethinking processes dynamically is key. In my carousel, I touched on how edge orchestration and agentic AI are enabling this, paving the way for intelligent, adaptive operations.",
