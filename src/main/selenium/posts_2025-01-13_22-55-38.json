      "content": "Last night, I couldn’t sleep.\n\nI kept thinking about a narrative that’s not only wrong but toxic—and honestly, it made my blood boil. The idea that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is somehow to blame for the California wildfires? It’s absurd. It’s sexist. And it’s damaging to the incredible women (and men!) risking their lives to protect their communities.\n\nSo, I did what anyone would do at 2 AM with a head full of thoughts and a keyboard within reach: I wrote about it.\n\nMy latest article dives into why this narrative is not only false but also a distraction from the real issues. It highlights how women like Fire Chief Kristin M. Crowley are not only qualified to lead but are leveraging groundbreaking technologies like AI to fight these fires in real-time.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: the article starts with the clickbait-y headline “Is DEI to Blame for the Fires in California?”—but spoiler alert: it’s not. In fact, DEI and automation are driving innovation in ways we can’t afford to ignore.\n\nThis one’s for anyone who believes in amplifying the truth, celebrating diversity, and calling out harmful narratives when they rear their heads. Read the article here, and let me know what you think. Let’s set the record straight—together. ‍\n\nLink:",

          "commentText": "Interesting paradigm shift to consider. Agree fully that gaining operating leverage while scaling is top of mind for operators and reducing support cost is likely one of the clearest vectors for accomplishing that (good case could also be made for being more scrupulous of GTM spend/GTM efficiency but that’s a separate convo). I am curious, though, about a couple of points on this issue…\n1. How far along this curve are some of the biggest incumbents? 2. What (if any) variance is seen by customers vis-a-vis resolution? If de minimis, this is obv highly compelling. If de minimis but lack of human interaction is perceived as lower value, the calculus gets a little murkier as possible attribution to other factors gets harder to calculate cleanly when more of this is offloaded from human headcount. 3. It seems many are making similar claims about resolution efficacy/efficiency but I suspect as with many metrics reported by nascent applications of bleeding age tech there is likely much noise in the data or the value prop to customers less clear than is being told. Net net I think it’s a great short term narrative in a drive toward profitability companies who need to improve margin.",

          "commentText": "Longer term, I’m curious/skeptical about the tradeoffs from moving too quickly down this path from a churn standpoint, especially for higher end enterprise saas and for lower end SMB SaaS. It’s reminiscent of much of the same narrative that was pitched regarding chatbots and how game changing they would be. Those helped unlocked scale but also caused a lot of frustration with customers. Will be curious how companies balance these tradeoffs. From the way many seem to be framing approach I suspect it will be brand dilutive and very frustrating to customers who likely already have fatigue toward the customer experience (or lackthereof). Jason of Saastr just did a pod where he discussed some of the narrative messaging around AI resolution efficacy from large incumbents (e.g., Zendesk and others) and it seems everyone is beating a similar drum. Will be curious to see who ultimately wins and what hybrid balance they strike.",
