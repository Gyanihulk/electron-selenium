      "content": " Have you ever considered who truly holds the reins to your career? It may sound like a simple question, but the answer is profoundly important! If you're in sales, take a look at some staggering stats from Objective Management Group: only 6% of salespeople are deemed \"Elite,\" while 14% are classified as good, and 20% barely hit the mark as acceptable.  What’s the rest of your sales team’s status? Are they C players or worse? If you're serious about turning this around, I've got the tools to help you identify and bridge these performance gaps!\n\nImagine a sales team where every member is driven to improve their skills and mindset! How would that elevate your business? When you start asking your team about their personal growth—what they've done in the last six months to step up their game—you might be shocked by the answers... or the lack thereof!  As a business owner, you have the power to empower your team, but remember: the responsibility lies with each salesperson to take charge of their own development. Are you investing in your own growth? If not, why should anyone else? \n\n Self-improvement isn't just a trendy phrase—it's the foundation of your future success. If you want to climb the ladder, you need to be the one investing in yourself! Whether it's cracking open a book about sales strategies or enrolling in an affordable course (many are under $200!), the opportunity to reshape your approach is right at your fingertips!  So, what are you waiting for? Embrace the grind, break free of your comfort zone, and let self-improvement become your new mantra! The impact on your career could be the game-changer you’ve been looking for!",

      "content": "Is there a secret cash prize for B2B companies who use the words \"revolutionize\" or \"transform\" in websites, ads, and webinar invites?\n\nThese words are intended to be positive.\n\nBut, personally, I think they scream \"this solution is going to be a lot of work to implement\".\n\nHere's an example.\n\nIn December, I ate like a bear preparing to hibernate. My diet was bad. Obviously, I wanted that to stop.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between clicking on:\n\n\"Transform Your Body In 90 Days\"\n\nor\n\n\"5 Surprisingly High Calorie Meals To Avoid at O'Hare Airport\"\n\nI'm picking the latter.\n\nBecause Jan-March is my busiest quarter. The language of \"transform\" suggests it's going to involve a lot of work.\n\nAnd, the 2nd option isn't pitching a solution in the copy.\n\nIt's illuminating a problem I hadn't considered (ex: maybe I thought a taco salad was a healthy choice, until I saw the calorie count of the deep friend salad shell). That sparks curiosity. It's taking me down a path to learn with them.\n\nNow, if at the end of that article, it linked to a paid meal plan solution with healthy options at all major US airports - I might click into that to learn more, and, maybe, buy it.\n\nBut, first, I have to feel like there's something they know that I don't. AND, I have to feel like it's not going to be an ungodly amount of effort to get there.\n\nMaybe I'm totally wrong here.\n\nBut, JOLT Effect taught us that 40-60% of B2B opps are lost to no-decision.\n\nOur buyers are overwhelmed. We often lose to \"it's too expensive\" (aka I'm worried we won't be able to do what is necessary to realize the full value) or \"it's too much to add to our plates right now\" (aka we're already swamped - do I want to add one more thing).\n\nI don't think \"transform\" and \"revolutionize\" help our case.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Here’s a couple ideas to keep working on:\n\n- the tonality - it’s reading as informative (“Most CFOs acquire…” and “which is costing you”). Unsure tonality will invite the prospect to correct our assumptions and reads less abrasive. “Looks like your team is building pip me from outbound and referrals.” (You could validate that by checking their sales job descriptions on career page.) Then, I’d insert some data on cold outbound channel effictiveness (simple google search). That sizes pain of current state. Then, you can help them do the math (vs telling them theyre losing $120k - which feels a bit out of nowhere - dont know how you got to it).\n\n- then, instead of making yourself the hero (“I helped”), make that client the hero (“acme took a different approach and added $10k in 3 months with…)",

You can't go on vacation\n🟥 Decision-making stops in your absence.\n Build a team that runs without you\n\n2. You only hear \"Yes\"\n🟥 Constant agreement masks fear.\n Thank those who challenge you.\n\n3. You are the bottleneck\n🟥 Everything waits for your approval.\n Trust reversible decisions.\n\n4. You can't think of the last question you asked\n🟥 All direction, no curiosity.\n Ask, \"What are we missing?\"\n\n5. You never see mistakes\n🟥 No risks, no innovation.\n Make failure safe - lead by example.\n\n6. Your best talent leaves\n🟥 Top talent craves freedom.\n Give trust, not orders.\n\n7. You are in back-to-back meetings\n🟥 Meetings replace trust.\n Opt out of meetings that don't need you.\n\n8. Your meetings are quiet\n🟥 Silent teams are scared teams.\n Ensure everyone's input.\n\n9. You discourage skip-level meetings\n🟥 All communication flows through you.\n Create direct connections.\n\n10. You can't name your employee's kids\n🟥 Distance creates disconnection.\n Learn what drives each person\n\n11. You're on the edge of burnout\n🟥 Control drains everyone.\n Model work-life boundaries.\n\nRemember:\n\nStrong teams are built on trust, not control.\n\n️ Share to help someone\n Followfor more",
