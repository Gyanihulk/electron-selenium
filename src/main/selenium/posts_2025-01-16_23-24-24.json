Pineapple Corp began to take shape, growing from a bold gamble into a thriving business.\n\n Now, Pineapple Corp stands as a testament to taking risks.\n\nIt's been a journey from uncertainty to success, proving that you can't win big if you're not willing to put something on the table.\n\nIf you're standing at a crossroads, wondering if the risk is worth the reward, let my story inspire you. \n\nGot a story of a big career switch?\n\nOr thinking about one?\n\nShare some insight and encouragement! ️",

Most of the time, we have to share hard truths with clarity and kindness. After hundreds of conversations with leaders, here are two simple things I've learned in preparing for those conversations.\n\nTiming and Emotional readiness are the keys to impactful dialogue, especially when the stakes are high.\n\nHere’s a framework I’ve developed to prepare for hard conversations:\n\n Find the Right Tension: Timing matters. To create meaningful change, the conversation must happen when both parties can fully engage and fight/flight is not already active.\n️ Too Late: Diminished Impact\n️ Too Soon: Damaging Impact\n\nTiming can be in 5 minutes or 5 weeks, but you must find a time when the person receiving the message can embrace the message's weight and take the appropriate action.\n\n️ Hard Conversations without action = pointless conflict\n\n Process the Emotional Journey: Without imagining the emotional flow of the conversation beforehand, I've often caught myself blindsided or, worse, unempathetic to what the other person might feel or take away from the conversation.\n\n️ Intentionally creates an opportunity for empathy to build credibility\n\nIf you ever need help from an outside voice or objective insight let us know.",
