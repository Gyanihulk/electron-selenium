      "content": "Is it just me, or are people more and more trying to fit the mold of \"perfect human being?\" It's not enough to be perfect at our jobs, we have to have perfect routines, coping methods, ways of being...\n\n\n“Do you still use a paper boarding pass???”\n\nMy daughter asked me this recently, incredulous. And yes, I do. Because deep down, I like to be over-prepared. Call it my risk manager’s instinct.\n\nWe all have quirks — habits, preferences, personality ticks that don’t always make sense but help us feel in control. The problem isn’t having them; it’s fighting them.\n\nWhen we resist our quirks, they turn into sources of shame or defensiveness. When we embrace them, they lose their power and let us focus on what really matters.\n\nFor me, that means accepting my harmless habits (like paper boarding passes) while addressing the quirks with real impact — like rushing through big decisions or getting defensive under stress.\n\nThe lesson? Not every imperfection needs fixing.\n\nFocus on the ones that truly affect your performance, your relationships, or your well-being. And let the rest go.\n\n\n\n(And a goofy selfie just to drive the point home.)",

      "content": "The assertion by Elon Musk that AI has “exhausted human knowledge” is a glaring fallacy. \n\nHuman knowledge, ingenuity, and mystery stretch far beyond what AI can process, encapsulate, or replicate.\n\nConsider the Great Pyramid of Giza, a marvel of engineering and precision that remains an enigma. Composed of 2,400,000 blocks, some weighing up to 70 tons, its precision—1 cm of error across the base and near-perfect alignment with cardinal points—is unmatched even with modern laser-guided systems. To meet the proposed timeline of 10 years, ancient builders would have placed one massive block every 60 seconds, for 10 hours a day, without fail—using tools no more advanced than copper.\n\nAI, for all its advancements, cannot decode such mysteries. It is trained on datasets curated by humans, yet vast reservoirs of knowledge remain untapped: oral traditions, undocumented histories, and the untranscribed nuances of thousands of languages. AI’s limitations are evident in its hallucinations—outputs that lack factual grounding—and the reliance on synthetic data, where models essentially recycle their own interpretations, risking a loop of diminishing reliability.\n\nKnowledge isn’t static. It is an evolving frontier defined by human curiosity, creativity, and the ability to grapple with the unknown. AI does not wonder, dream, or innovate; it learns patterns within the known. If the Great Pyramid, built 4,500 years ago, still defies comprehension, how could machines, bound by finite datasets, ever claim mastery over the vastness of human thought?\n\nAI is a transformative tool, but it remains a mirror of human input—not a rival to human intellect. Let us not diminish humanity’s depth by calling it “exhausted.” Instead, let AI complement our endless pursuit of discovery, as we venture into realms it cannot yet fathom.",

However your thesis still didn't disprove Mr. Musk's point since you yourself have pointed out that the pyramids represent 'lost' knowledge, i.e. no longer available to humanity much like NASA has 'forgotten' how to get to the moon and we are now relearning this knowledge.

          "commentText": "Francis Joseph thank you for your thoughtful response. While I agree that some knowledge might appear ‘lost,’ I would argue it is often dormant rather than permanently gone. The knowledge behind the pyramids or NASA’s lunar feats was not eradicated—it evolved or was deprioritized as humanity’s needs shifted. AI, however, cannot ‘lose’ or ‘rediscover’ knowledge because it doesn’t possess agency, curiosity, or the iterative growth process unique to human ingenuity. Musk’s assertion fails to account for the expansive, regenerative capacity of human creativity, which goes far beyond simply relearning. The pyramids and space travel are powerful examples of humanity’s ability to transcend eras—not limits.",
