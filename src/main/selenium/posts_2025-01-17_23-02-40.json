Part of this evolution.\n\nYes, there are things we can do to adapt and thrive.\n\nBut also, remember to understand what's really happening:\n\nWhen AI can handle 80% of routine work by learning from our patterns, when Salesforce completely freezes engineering hiring but adds 2,000 salespeople, we're not just entering a new era.\n\nWe're entering the next phase of human-AI collaboration.\n\nThe question isn't if AI will change engineering.\n\nIt's how we'll evolve with it.\n\nLike every technological revolution, those who adapt first will shape what comes next.",
