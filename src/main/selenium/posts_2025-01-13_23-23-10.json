The lawsuit brought forward claims that Apple frequently recorded users' private conversations without their consent when Siri was unintentionally activated. Furthermore, it was alleged that this recorded data was shared with advertisers. As part of the settlement, affected users are expected to receive compensation, potentially amounting to $20 for each Siri-enabled device they own.
