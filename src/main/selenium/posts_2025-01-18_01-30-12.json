Then maybe hold off on big changes\n- Do your buyers get the same great experience with every seller?\n- Can your frontline managers blend this into their existing coaching?\n- Have you gotten everyone's input before rolling this out?\n\n\nIn the full episode, we dove into:\n\n- Which sales methodologies actually work (and which don't)\n- How to get real buy-in (not just surface-level agreement)\n- Making new methods stick without breaking what works\n- Smart ways to test and implement on deadline\n- Tech that actually supports your rollout\n\n\nCheck out the full conversation in the comments",

Imagine being a solid performer for years, contributing to major projects, only to have your employer retroactively label you as \"low performing\" during layoffs. Now you're forced to walk into every job interview with this cloud hanging over you, having to defend your capabilities against a narrative you never got to counter. This isn't about performance management - it's about companies protecting their stock price and image by throwing their departing employees under the bus. Using layoffs as an excuse to tarnish the reputations of the very people who helped build your company.\nTo anyone affected: You don't owe future employers an explanation for corporate spin. Your worth isn't determined by an exit PR strategy.",
