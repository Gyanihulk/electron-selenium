Imagine combining email with a smart voice AI. Sounds cool, right?\n\nHere’s the issue: We all know that no-shows can zap your time and mood.  Your team tries so hard to book those calls, but folks either miss or skip them. Ouch.\n\nEnter voice AI, the superhero of reminders! ‍️ Picture this: 60-90 minutes before the call, the AI gives your clients a quick call. It’s like a friendly nudge saying, “Hey, don’t forget about your call!”  And if they can’t make it? No worries! The AI helps them reschedule right away. Win-win!\n\nThis trick can boost your show rates and make your sales team happier.  Because more calls mean more chances to close the deal!\n\nWant to see it in action? DM us and let’s set it up for you!",

Lack of trust in 3PL accuracy.\n\n- Shopify POS limitations and lack of integrations with popular online store apps.\n\n- Shopify SEO for founders, everything about it. < follow.\n\nIf you’re stuck with something, want to validate an idea you have OR want to find an idea, get on the phone with the right people, ask good questions and listen.",

This means you cannot tie a payout to a transaction to an order to an inventory deduction. If Shopify could find a way to align their reporting to make it easier to work with ERPs our runway with Shopify would be MUCH longer. It just takes too much labor to decode our reports each month. Custom reporting for base tiers was just rolled out but it still lacks any connection between the funds deposited (which much be reconciled) back to the order line items.\n\nAs a huge fan of the platform and the success it has brought us, it's tough to struggle so much with what our clients expect to be the \"easy\" part of the solution (reporting basic transaction data). Being \"pretty\" and \"easy to setup\" can only take you so far. Other platforms seem more able to report to ERPs at the sacrifice of UX and ease-of-use.\n\nOur clients will show us the squarespace reports that we should be able to replicate - we just can't. It's an embarrassing moment in the discovery process.\n\nI'll concede that I do understand by separating the checkout from store order each can be optimized independently, which has immense benefits - but only for startups.",
