There's a HUGE difference between what Mark Zuckerberg is doing, in cutting 5-10% of Meta's workforce, and HOW he's doing it.\n\nWhether we like it or not, and many of us do not, the CEOs job is to maximize shareholder value.\n\nIf, by cutting the lowest performing individuals that helps bolster the bottom line and profit margins, he's doing his job.\n\nDid he have to be so open about it?\n\nDid he have to say it right after abolishing their DEI programs, and going on Joe Rogan's podcast to discuss how Meta \"needs more masculinity?\"\n\nI'd have advised against that myself. But these leaders have neither had to be particularly self-aware, or accountable for their actions beyond those profits.\n\nBut make no mistake about it.\n\nManaging people out, due to performance does NOT make a performance culture.\n\nThat's something you have to invest in. You have to believe and want your people to succeed. You have to have an environment and supportive culture that allows you to be the best version of yourself to perform.\n\nBut none of these companies have any interest in that.\n\nThey just want the performance without having to give anything back in return.\n\nThey could do better. They could do a lot better by their people.\n\nThey simply choose not to.\n\nWork Hard. Be Kind. Let Good Things Happen!",

Performance assessments are heavily influenced by a manager's bias for certain individuals as well as particular demographics that the company wants to rid themselves of.\n\nCompanies frequently tell managers to come up with low performers - even if they are not - to meet a quota. You will also often see as part of a layoff demotions. They retain certain low performers due to the relationships those people have not based on their actual performance.\n\nIn my experience, those included in layoffs are predominantly in one of 3 camps:\n- those with skills that have been deemed commodity or obsolete (even if that person is a very high performer)\n- Individuals who have reported discrimination or harassment\n- those in certain protected classes where this is a legal way to eliminate them. This includes higher paid older workers as well as women. Remote workers are also being targe nis point.\n\nAll of these are leadership failures.\n\nWhy people take the word of someone who has proven himself to be untrustworthy is mind boggling.",

The day he told me I said \"I guarantee she will find a way to get rid of me.\" And she did. He fought that too but my fate was sealed.\n\nI've been very outspoken about that layoff but it's not because of I'm bitter for my own sake. The environment was so toxic and unhealthy. It's because I loathe bullies and unethical behavior. I've fought them since I was a kid and have no tolerance for it.\n\nI struggle with how readily people acquiesce and enable these behaviors.

When your workforce thinks you’re a terrible human, they’ll never give you anything more than the minimum.\n\nMaybe the minimum is 80 hours a week, but what will be lost is innovation, creative problem solving or doing anything outside of what is absolutely required to stay employed.

      "content": "Here's how hard Linkedin REALLY is:\n\nWant to be one of the best on here?\n\nLet's highlight some of the things I do on the regular\n\n→ I literally comment for about 2-3 hours each day\n→ This is every single morning when I post\n→ I write 2 posts a day 4 days a week\n→ I respond to nearly every DM\n→ I dig into the analytics\n→ It doesn't end\n\nIs this easy? Yes and no.\n\n→ I can comment like a machine.\n→ Doing the work isn't like rocket science\n→ Putting in the hours doesn't intimidate me\n→ But it's taxing and grueling thus making it hard.\n\nTHIS is what it takes:\n\n→ Writing targeted content\n→ Engaging every day like crazy\n→ Responding to every comment and DM\n→ Doing the same stuff over and over and over\n→ Getting ZERO results for a really really long time\n\nOn TOP of that?\n\n→ You have to do it for YEARS, not months\n→ You have to be nimble and adapt\n→ You cannot be stubborn\n\nAnd here's something else:\n\n→ That's what it takes to grow your Linkedin account.\n→ That's JUST a Linkedin account.\n→ That's not my business\n\nI still have community, client and sales calls.\n\nLet's get something straight.\n\n→ This is a CHOICE.\n→ I take full responsibility.\n→ I can easily work 2-4 hrs a day\n→ Thankfully I've done well over the years\n\nBut if any of you are out there wondering why you aren't growing on here or in any other aspect of your life, check again.\n\nAre you REALLY doing what it takes?\n\nChances are you are NOT.\n\nIf you want the real truth, stick with me, I won't hold back.\n\nREPOST ️ to someone who needs to hear this",

I can pay someone to comment for me or not. It's a bs game that we've been sucked into in my opinion. I'd rather spend money on targeted ads - doesn't take up my time and you can scale. I'm not criticising you at all. I just won't do what you've done.",
