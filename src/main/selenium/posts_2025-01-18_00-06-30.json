      "content": "The definition of top 1% founder is different today, don‚Äôt get sucked in to ‚Äúbuilding great product is enough‚Äù\n\nI speak to 100s of founders every year, and most believe that building a great product is enough.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the truth: the top-performing founders do much more.\n\nFollow these essentials to set you apart:\n\n- Talk to your users every week\n- Solve real problems, not just build features\n- Focus on what works, not what's trending\n- Build with intention, not FOMO\n- Take care of your mental health\n- Have a small team that believes in your vision\n- Stay close to your core product\n- Measure impact, not just metrics\n\nI see founders constantly chasing the next big thing. New technologies, bigger teams, faster growth.\n\nBut here's what I've learned helping founders build companies; the fundamentals haven't changed:\n‚Üí Users who love your product\n‚Üí a team that believes in the mission,\n‚Üí and problems worth solving\n\nthese are still what separate great companies from good ones.\n\nIt's not about doing everything.\nIt's about doing the right things well.\n\nIf you've got these basics right, you're already building something special.\n\nWhat keeps you focused on what matters?",

By taking action we may fail but the holy grail of the entrepreneur is to fail early and fail often so that you will have time and energy to transform your failures into lessons and thus success.\nAlso great founders are ahead of their times. Yes, they are great visionaries but their visions are in sync with real world. Every product or idea addresses a pain, to be precise pain of their customer.\nAlso growth has to be sustainable. An individual is not enough to achieve world class success. We need team of cofounders with shared mission and vision. When one of cofounder is low on energy then team of others should come forward and pull him up. The mental health issues need to be addressed from time to time.",

      "content": "What is HRBITDA?? Any guesses :)\n\nThink of it as EBITDA for HR‚Äîquantifying the measurable value HR brings to the table.\n\nHRBITDA (Human Resources Benefits, Impact, Talent, Development, and Alignment) captures the value HR delivers in a business. It mirrors the concept of EBITDA by stripping away the intangible complexities of HR to focus on real, measurable outcomes like retention, engagement, and leadership development.\n\nHRBITDA is your organization‚Äôs EBITDA for HR‚Äîmeasuring HR‚Äôs true impact on business success\n1. Retention ROI = Cost Saved from Reduced Attrition + Lower Hiring Expenses\n2. Engagement ROI = Gains from Improved ESAT and Productivity\n3. Leadership ROI = Succession Readiness + Leadership Retention Metrics\n4. Recruitment Efficiency = Time-to-Hire Savings + Quality-of-Hire Benefits\n\n\nHow to track key metrics for your HRBITDA?\n\n‚Ä¢ Retention Health = % of Key Talent Retained\n‚Ä¢ Engagement Health = ESAT Scores / Attrition Rates\n‚Ä¢ Talent Pipeline Readiness = Promotions from Within / Total Leadership Hires\n‚Ä¢ Diversity Impact = Representation in Decision-Making Roles\n\nHow to Build your value?\n\n1. Start-Employee Productivity Improvements\n2. Add- Leadership Development ROI (Succession Planning, Retention)\n3. Add- D&I Wins (Innovation & Inclusion Gains)\n4. Add- Recruitment Efficiencies (Cost and Time Savings)\n5. Add- Well-Being ROI (Improved mental health + Reduced Burnout + Increased Productivity)\n\nNow let‚Äôs start from Impact\n\nReverse-engineer HRBITDA from organizational success\n1. Begin- Business Performance Metrics (Revenue/Employee)\n2. Subtract- Costs from Attrition and Misalignments\n3. Add Back- Gains from Upskilling, Cultural Alignment, and Retention\n4. Result - HRBITDA\n\nWhy I believe it works?\n\n‚Ä¢ Translates HR‚Äôs value into measurable business outcomes.\n‚Ä¢ Mirrors EBITDA to resonate with leadership and financial stakeholders.\n‚Ä¢ Simplifies HR‚Äôs impact into clear, actionable metrics.\n‚Ä¢ Aligns people initiatives with organizational goals.\n\nStrategic HR Highlights as per my experience\n‚Ä¢ Retention ROI- Saved ‚ÇπXX lakhs by reducing attrition through personalized IDPs.\n‚Ä¢ Engagement ROI- Boosted ESAT by 15%, driving 10% higher team productivity.\n‚Ä¢ Leadership Impact- Increased succession readiness by 40%, ensuring continuity.\n‚Ä¢ Recruitment Efficiency- Reduced time-to-hire by 50%, saving ‚ÇπXX lakhs annually.\n‚Ä¢ D&I ROI- Achieved 5% growth in women in leadership, driving innovation.\n\nDo you think this remotely makes sense?? OR I am just being silly \n\nHRBITDA in practice?\n\n‚Ä¢ Check Metrics-Monitor retention, productivity, and engagement regularly.\n‚Ä¢ Normalize Data- Benchmark against industry standards.\n‚Ä¢ Report Impact-Present HRBITDA as a strategic enabler of growth and profitability.\n‚Ä¢ Tie to Business-Show how HR delivers measurable ROI.\n\nThoughts leaders???",
