Lighting, stable camera, and audio all perfect for a impromptu recording? Not likely. We can imply that the person filming this could have program the robot to lie as part of a scripted performances.\nSo the validity of this video is in question.\n\nNext if this is a real impromptu recording, we are in big trouble.\nProgramming a machine to arbitrary lie is dangerous.\nMy question here is, why did this robot want to lie? What motivated this robot to lie? Why was this function (lying) programed in to this robot?\nThere is a lot more to ask and discuss on these questions, but I leave that to another post.\n\nThere is more than AI ethics to review here. There is the base line of how we will build these devices.\n\nWe don’t make machine that lie to us!\n\nHas your car ever lied to you about its ability to get you around safely?\nHas a ATM ever lied about your balance?\nHas any medical equipment, during a operation, lie about the condition of the patient?\nHas the air defense ever lied about a missal attack?\n\nWe don’t make machine that lie.\n\nLets not start now.",

And it just gets easier when EMPATHY comes into picture to actually:\n- decode your customer's thought process,\n- understand their pain points and then\n- show the solution (your product/service)\n\nThis is why we have educational emails in the eCommerce retention game. These babies stem out of customer's pains and that's why they always win their hearts!
