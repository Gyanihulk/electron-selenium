          "commentText": "I have heard many stories of working class and neurodiverse kids especially being told by 'career counsellors' what they will not be able to achieve. An approach that non-judgmentally took into account what kids think they might like to do and projected a concrete image might be particularly beneficial for kids without role models in their environment. My only concern is that this projects a superficial image; it's about looks, not essence. DallE's vision of a scientist involves a labcoat, but most scientists wear regular clothes - which might be a plus if you're a bright kid who's not into uniforms... As usual AI is one of many handy tools and needs supplementing with dialogue and open-minded, informed adults who care.",

      "content": "Last year I left my corporate job and never looked back.\n\nIn every job I’ve held in my career, I’d always felt like an imposter.\n\nBut it wasn’t the type of imposter syndrome that made me feel like I was inadequate.\n\nIt was the type of imposter syndrome that made me feel like I was living two different lives between work and life.\n\nBecause I could never get behind the idea of building someone else’s dream.\n\nSo I kept switching jobs each year thinking that a new environment would drown out the thoughts of being but a cog in the machine.\n\nUntil I couldn’t do it anymore.\n\nSo here are my tips if you want to turn your passions into your career one day (so that you don’t end up paying for someone else’s Lambo!):\n\n1. Assess your skills vs market demand\n\n↳ Identify what you excel at and are passionate about vs there are gaps in the market.\n\n2. Build your financial safety net\n\n↳ Aim to save enough to cover your expenses for 3-6 months so that you have the freedom to explore opportunities without the immediate pressure of generating income.\n\n3. Start small, test the waters\n\n↳ Start your own projects while you’re still employed, e.g. volunteer, freelance work, so that you can gauge your interest and the viability of your business idea without fully committing right away.\n\n4. Leverage social media\n\n↳ Creating valuable content like tutorials, tips, or industry insights on platforms like LinkedIn will allow you to position yourself as an authority in your field.\n\n2025 is the year we start building toward our own dreams.\n\nFollow mefor more tips like these!",

It talked about when Elon started working with Tesla.\n\nElon pushed to automate everything!\n\nTake all the humans out of the process!!!\n\n(I started chuckling to myself because I knew what would happen next...)\n\nTesla was starting to experience quality issues and countless production delays. Elon went to the production floor and started watching the robots. He found the automation was struggling with their assigned tasks like installing nuts and bolts.\n\nAs they tried to troubleshoot the robots, they realized humans could complete that task faster than the robot AND with zero defects.\n\nOne by one each process was reevaluated. If a human could outperform the robot at that given task, the robot was drug out to the parking lot and a human took it's place.\n\nWith Lean we teach that automation is the very last thing a process needs.\n\nHumans can see opportunities for improvement, detect and prevent defects, and adapt to changes in the process.\n\nMoral of the story:\n\nBefore you invest in pricey automation...\n\nINVEST IN YOUR PEOPLE FIRST!!!\n\nAfter all, humans are the only investment that APPRECIATES over time.",

Just let new tools augment your work force. I don't understand the race to replace everyone. IF you took that to the logical extreme only businesses would generate any income and then go under because there would be no one left to consume any products.\n\nWe live on a planet full of people trying to find meaning and purpose.

Travel is the best mentor\n\nI was in Japan for 2 months.\n\nThe:\n\n• Sites\n• Culture\n• Way of living\n\nAre a whole new world to me.\n\nIt's difficult to step out of your comfort zone - but you learn to accept change as you travel.\n\nIt's the secret path to mental resilience.\n\n2. Appreciate different cultures\n\nAll humans really just want:\n\n• Love\n• Family\n• Freedom\n• Friendship\n• Happiness\n\nEverything else is secondary.\n\nSo embrace the sameness.\n\nIt's the very fiber of people that transcends languages and borders.\n\n3. Pack Light, Gain More\n\nI live out of 1 suitcase and 1 bag.\n\nThe more things, the more baggage - literally and figuratively.\n\nBut when you pack light, you realize how little you truly need to be happy.\n\nDon't let your possessions possess you.\n\n4. Make friends with strangers\n\nIn 2023, I was living in Puerto Escondido for 6 months.\n\nOne day, at a cafe, I met a woman who brightened up my day.\n\nI asked her out - now she's my girlfriend and we're traveling the world together.\n\nSo treat every person you meet like they could be a lifelong friend.\n\n5. Travel Will Frazzle\n\nFor 2 days after I land somewhere new, I'm always anxious.\n\nBut that's okay.\n\nI focus on:\n\n• Finding a gym\n• Getting out into nature\n\nAnd being patient with myself.\n\nAfter 48 hours, I know my feeling of anxiety will pass.\n\n6. Learn to think outside of the box\n\n\"It's easier for me to get ready for a game on the road because you're expected to lose.\n\nThat's a challenge that perks my competitive juices.\"\n\n- Michael Jordan\n\nI play better away, too.\n\nI get constant creativity, inspiration, and focus from new places.\n\n7. Maintain Balance\n\nRunning successful businesses while traveling every 3 months is a juggling act.\n\nMake sure to balance:\n\n• Personal growth\n• Business growth\n• Relationships\n\nSometimes one comes at the expense of another and that's okay.\n\nBalance wins in the long run.\n\n8.

      "content": "Here are a few thoughts about what not to say when someone has endured the devastation that is happening in LA (or that happened in Florida, New Orleans, North Carolina or anywhere in the world). \n\n1) Don't offer something specific (e.g. I have some extra jackets, would you like them?) because then you put the person in the position of having to say no to you when they are already overwhelmed. Offering broad support is so much easier: I'm here. Whatever you need. Anytime.\n\n2) Don't offer support that requires them to be somewhere at a specific time. They are living each day as it comes and while your offer to bring dinner at 7pm on Thursday is generous, they don't know where they'll be at 7pm or whether they'll be interested in dinner.\n\n3) Don't ask them for the specifics. What did you lose is the worst question you can ask.\n\n4) Whatever you do, don't ask to see pictures of their burnt-down home, and don't visit their burnt property unless you're specifically invited. This is extremely painful—like looking at a dead carcass of your memories.\n\n5) The worst question and comments are those that somehow imply they could've done more. For example, don't casually mention \"my friends in Altadena hosed down their house and their house was spared.\" or \"My friends just cleared the brush from their house last year so their house is fine.\"\n\n6) Don't tell them about other people who have it worse. Their pain is their own. Your compassion comes from listening, not telling.\n\n7) Don't \"look on the positive\" to them. Don't say \"at least you're all safe. That's more important than things.\" That implies they don't already know that. Believe me, they do!\n\n8) Don't add to their grief. When I told one friend my house had burned, she broke down sobbing and I had to console her. This is not the time to break down about your grief in their loss.\n\n9) Don't tell them that this loss is the universe/God telling them something. If this is your belief, hold it to yourself. No one going through this wants to hear someone else interpret what the universe/God is telling them or that there is a lesson you think they need to learn.\n\n10) The natural tendency is to try to learn from what happened by asking detailed questions that will keep us safe in the future. Don't do that. Don't ask if they evacuated on time or their smoke alarms went off or if they hosed down their house.\n\nSimply tell them you are grateful they are safe. You are there for them, whatever they need. And let them tell you their story when they're ready.",

I’m sorry for what you’ve been through that taught you all these lessons but grateful you’re sharing it. \n\nI’ll add one more thing. Put a reminder in your phone to reach out at regular intervals in the future to just check in, tell them you’re thinking of them and offer support.\n\nAnd always put an annual reminder in your calendar. This day and time of year will be painful for years to come. Everyone else will move on, but they’ll be reminded of the loss every year. Just sending a text to say you’re thinking of them will mean SO much.\n\nThis is all true for every kind of loss, pain, or grief.",

And then insulting local leadership for not doing enough. Really? \n\nExacerbated by 8 months of dry conditions, those firefighters are facing fires with hurricane winds. So a previous comment from the incoming President that had they had just \"raked their forests\" none of this would have happened. Oh, and there's doubling down on #5.\n\nThe outgoing President has been called the Consoler in Chief, which may make the losses that much better, but at least better than being scolded. But on a positive note, when disasters strike, people genuinely want to help, and that's what makes up strong. I'm in MN was heard that a group of firefighters from northern MN, where we do see a few forest fires, has been sent to help.",
