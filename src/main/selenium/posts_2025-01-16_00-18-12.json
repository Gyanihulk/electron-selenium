      "content": "What if I knew then what I know now? \n\nIf you've ever wished you could run your hands through the river of time, catching fragments of the life you've already lived, then you‚Äôve felt the ache of avenoir.\n\nAvenoir is one of those hauntingly beautiful words from the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows ‚Äî the bittersweet desire to see where you‚Äôve been, to watch your past unfold before you like a film, scene by scene.\n\nImagine you are standing at the edge of your timeline. What would you say to the younger versions of yourself‚Äîthe dreamer, the risk-taker, the heartbroken?\n\nWould you cheer them on, warn them, or simply watch, mesmerized by the unfolding story of your life?\n\nThe ache of avenoir‚Äîlonging to look back and rewrite our story with the wisdom we‚Äôve gained in the present‚Äîcan be overwhelming.\n\nHowever, if we didn‚Äôt experience both sides of the polarity spectrum, how would we truly appreciate the human experience?\n\nThe grand design of the universe is no accident. In this third-dimensional reality, where time and space are our constructs, we experience life in a linear fashion.\n\nEach moment builds on the last, forcing us to move forward, whether we‚Äôre ready or not. While quantum physics reveals a reality where all timelines run concurrently, we live through the lens of time, experiencing life step by step in the physical for reasons known only to the forces that set this world in motion billions of years ago.\n\nWe may long for the clarity of hindsight at the moment, but without the lessons learned through pain, joy, failure, and triumph, the wisdom we cherish now simply wouldn‚Äôt exist.\n\nDespite what some may say, this linear journey is not a punishment; it‚Äôs a gift. A chance to evolve in ways only the limitations of time can teach us.\n\nTherefore, if you find yourself longing for a do-over, remember this: the heartbreaks taught you about the power of love, the mistakes showed you the grace of humility, and the moments of triumph proved you‚Äôre capable of anything and everything you set your mind to.\n\nSo, the next time you feel the pull of avenoir, remember that the story behind you is as it's meant to be. And like any great tale, perhaps it‚Äôs here to teach us that life isn‚Äôt meant to be perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs meant to be lived.\n\nKeep Shining ‚≠ê\n¬©Angelique Letizia",

It could be up to two years before people can move back into the area because of the toxic chemicals in the air that will be released during the cleanup.\n\nIt's been amazing watching how the LA community has rallied together to help anyone and everyone (regardless of age, race, sex, religion, or political position). This is a human problem and will take years to recover from.\n\nWhat people need most right now is housing. There are tens of thousands of people displaced (even people who have homes to go back to need housing).\n\nThis is an open-source link to available leases in the LA area. Please share this. As you can imagine, it's constantly growing, shrinking, and evolving. I'll also add it in the comments section.\n\n\n\nThis is a link to an insane amount of resources because the uphill journey for many includes freezing mortgage payments, fighting with insurance companies, sorting out cleanup, or finding new schools. This is a great resource for free support.(link also in the comments)\n\nPlease, everyone, now is not the time to point fingers at politicians. This is a time to show up for each other.\n\nNote: survivors guilt is real, in fact, I sold my house a few months ago, so while I'm lucky, I feel so guilty and still devastated for the new owners and the entire PP community!",
