It feels inauthentic and robotic.\"\n\nTrue story...\n\nLast month, a client of mine came to me:\n\n• Confused\n• Frustrated\n• Overwhelmed\n\nAnd shockingly close to being defeated...\n\nMy client is a career coach.\n\nShe loves her work and knows she can change lives, but…\n\nShe hated selling in the DMs.\n\nHer exact words?\n\n\"I feel robotic. Like I'm following a script that doesn't sound like me.\"\n\nI get it.\n\nDM selling has a bad reputation because too many people use pushy, template-filled tactics that scream “spam.”\n\nAnd my client wasn’t about that.\n\nSo, during our clarity call, we broke it down...\n\nWhat if she didn’t have to “sell” in DMs?\n\nWhat if we used my One Conversation Conversion Method instead?\n\nIt’s simple.\n\nHere’s what I taught her:\n\n1. Understand their problem.\n\nDMs aren’t for pitching; they’re for learning.\n\nAsk questions that show you care.\n\nBecause dream clients only care about your solution\n\nWhen they feel cared for.\n\n2. Give empathy\n\nMost prospects feel misunderstood by cookie-cutter solutions.\n\nProve you get it.\n\nDon't come off as disingenuous, either.\n\nYou're not looking for everyone\n\nYou're looking for the right one.\n\n3. Position yourself as the solution\n\nWhen the time’s right, connect the dots between their struggle and your offer.\n\nThis is what makes the conversation natural and a no-brainer for your dream client.\n\n4. Close with confidence\n\nIf you can help, don’t delay.\n\nExplain the next steps clearly and confidently.\n\nThe trick here is to not \"commoditize\" yourself.\n\nThat's how you close.\n\nNo scripts.\nNo spammy vibes.\nNo robotic templates.\n\nWe tested it out that week with her leads.\n\nThe results?\n\nShe closed 3 new clients.\n\nThe best part? She told me,\n\n“I feel like myself again.”\n\nAnd that’s the goal.\n\nIf my client can do it, anyone can.\n\nP.S.\n\nIf you’re a solopreneur or coach who hates selling in DMs, I’m looking to help 5 people add predictable revenue and close consistent clients with my One Conversation Conversion Method.\n\nNo scripts. No sales calls. Just results.\n\nDM me the word \"CONVERSATION\" if you’re interested, and I’ll send you the details.\n\n---\n\nMy students are making $100+ a day with tripwire funnels\n\nWanna build your own?\n\nJoin my free 3-day challenge:",

It’s not their responsibility to reply.\n\nThis doesn’t mean referrals aren’t helpful, they absolutely are!\nBut you shouldn’t depend only on them.\n\nInstead, explore other ways to find opportunities, like using third-party platforms, sending cold emails, and connecting with alumni.\n\nReferrals are a part of the process, not the only way. Use every resource available and make the most of them.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out.",

I could see the bigger picture and got better at sharing it with the team. \n\nHere's what I worked on:\n\n\n Wireframing and future roadmaps \n\n Cutting down old tech problems ️\n\n Matching our tech efforts with what the business needs \n\nIt all clicked when:\n\n I realized how much money and time I was saving the company.\n\n I adapted to their schedules, making everyone's life easier.\n\n️ Turns out, my advice was pretty spot on!\n\nThe big moment?\n\n Seeing the cost savings really add up.\n\n The team, once struggling, now back on track with much less tech debt and risk.\n\nThis job wasn’t just about software - it was about changing things and building trust.\n\n Results? Faster work, better systems, and a united team.\n\n What I figured out? Stick with it, keep learning, and the impact will follow.\n\nDo you ever wonder if what you’re doing is really making a difference? Sometimes, it takes a while to see results. \n\nEver doubted your impact? How did it turn out?",
